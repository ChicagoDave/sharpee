Review Checklist
File Management

 Start with ChatGPT files 1-5 (earliest thinking)
 Process Claude files in batches of 5-10
 Track which files have been reviewed
 Note file numbers/names that had important decisions

For Each File

 Scan for architectural decisions (not code details)
 Identify if decision still exists in current architecture
 Note if decision was later reversed/changed
 Extract the "why" behind decisions

Decision Categories to Track

 Event system design
 World Model structure
 Parser approach
 Text generation patterns
 Trait/Behavior system
 Author experience choices

Output Format
File: claude-X.txt
Decisions Found:
1. [Decision]: [Still active/Changed/Abandoned]
   - Why: [Reasoning]
2. ...

Update needed for: [Which decision file]
After Each Batch

 Update relevant decision files
 Add changed decisions to decision-changes.md
 Identify patterns across multiple files
 Flag any contradictions found

This systematic approach should help extract the valuable architectural history without getting bogged down in implementation details.
