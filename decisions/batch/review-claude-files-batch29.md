# Sharpee Architecture Decisions - Batch 29

## File: 2025-05-25-12-25-08.json
**Topic**: Refactoring Crisis and Code Review

### Decision: Tool Issues and Refactoring Problems

**Context**: Multiple issues affecting the refactoring process:
1. Claude Desktop continuing to erase responses
2. Attempted to use alternative tool (Windsurfer) but it was "unusable"
3. Uncertainty about code state after failed refactoring attempts

**Decision**: 
Need to assess whether the code is in a usable state or requires rollback of all changes and restart of refactoring.

**Rationale**: Failed tool usage may have left the code in an inconsistent state. Need to determine viability before proceeding.

### Decision: Incremental Review Approach

**Context**: Due to Claude Desktop bug, large reviews risk being lost.

**Decision**: 
Review code in small increments, starting with packages/core only.

**Rationale**: Small increments reduce risk of losing work due to conversation erasure. Focusing on one package at a time makes review manageable.

### Critical Project State

**Status**: The project is at a critical juncture where:
- Refactoring has been attempted with multiple tools
- Code state is uncertain
- May need to rollback and restart
- Tool reliability issues are impacting development

**Impact**: This represents a potential major setback that could require:
1. Full code review to assess damage
2. Potential rollback of changes
3. Restart of refactoring effort
4. Revised approach to avoid tool issues

### Development Process Challenges

This chat highlights several process challenges:
1. **Tool Reliability** - Claude Desktop erasing responses
2. **Alternative Tools** - Windsurfer proved unusable
3. **Code Integrity** - Uncertainty about current state
4. **Communication** - Need for small increments due to tool issues

## Lessons Learned

1. **Version Control Critical** - Need ability to rollback when tools fail
2. **Incremental Changes** - Smaller changes are safer with unreliable tools
3. **Tool Selection** - Not all development tools are suitable for the project
4. **Review Before Proceeding** - Must assess state before continuing work
