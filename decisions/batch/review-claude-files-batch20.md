**Title:** Resolving TypeScript Errors in Movement Handler

### Context:
This session focused on fixing TypeScript errors and ESLint warnings in the stdlib package, specifically in the movement handler and other command handlers.

### TypeScript Error Fixed:
- Type mismatch in movement-handler.ts canHandle method
- Error: "Type 'string | boolean | undefined' is not assignable to type 'boolean'"
- Fixed by adding explicit type checks (=== true, !== undefined)

### Decisions Found:

1. **Explicit Boolean Type Checking**: [Still Active]
   - Why: TypeScript requires explicit handling of potentially undefined values
   - Use strict equality checks (=== true, !== undefined) instead of implicit conversions
   - Ensures TypeScript can correctly infer return types

2. **Interface Consistency Over Unused Parameters**: [Important Decision]
   - Why: Method signatures must match base class interface even if parameters unused
   - The user raised the question "didn't we put them there for a reason?"
   - Discovery: BaseCommandHandler defines interface requiring context parameter
   - Decision: Keep unused parameters for interface consistency, add comments explaining why
   - This maintains polymorphism and allows base class to call methods uniformly

3. **Early Returns Pattern Continuation**: [Reinforced]
   - Why: Simplifies complex boolean logic and avoids type issues
   - Continuation of pattern from previous status update
   - Preferred over complex boolean expressions

### Key Technical Details:
- canHandle and validate methods must match BaseCommandHandler interface
- Even if context parameter is unused, removing it breaks polymorphism
- Unused imports can be safely removed without affecting interface compatibility

### Notable Patterns:
- Interface-driven design where method signatures are dictated by base class
- Trade-off between clean code (no unused params) and interface consistency
- Use of comments to explain design decisions in code

### Implementation Details:
- Added explicit boolean checks to fix TypeScript errors
- Initially removed unused parameters, then reverted based on interface requirements
- Added comments explaining why unused parameters are kept

### Status:
The session successfully fixed TypeScript errors while discovering and respecting the interface requirements of the base command handler pattern. This shows mature architectural thinking about maintaining consistency across the handler hierarchy.
