2. **2025-06-15-20-48-06.json** - "Core Package Cleanup Checklist"
   - **Architectural Decision: Separate IF-specific code from Core**
     - Core should only contain generic narrative engine components (event system, channel system, extension interfaces, rule engine, pure data types)
     - StdLib should contain all IF-specific implementations (parser, IF constants, world model, IF actions)
   
   - **Architectural Decision: Clean package boundaries**
     - Core has zero IF imports
     - StdLib imports from Core only interfaces
     - Forge imports from both Core and StdLib
     - No circular dependencies
   
   - **Architectural Decision: Movement systems belong in stdlib**
     - MOVEMENT_SYSTEMS export (compass, nautical, clock navigation) identified as IF-specific
     - Should be moved from core to stdlib

## Summary

The second file contains active refactoring work to enforce a cleaner architecture by separating Interactive Fiction concerns from the generic narrative engine core. This is a significant architectural change that creates better separation of concerns and allows the core to be truly IF-agnostic.
