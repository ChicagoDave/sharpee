## Major Architectural Decisions:

### 1. **Three-Layer Architecture**: [Still active]
   - DataStore Layer → IFWorld Layer → StandardLibrary Layer
   - Clear separation between generic graph storage and IF-specific concepts
   - IFWorld acts as translator/facade between layers

### 2. **Graph-Based Foundation**: [Still active]
   - Generic in-memory graph data store (Nodes, Edges, Properties)
   - World Model doesn't know about IF specifically
   - Enables flexible relationships and properties

### 3. **Language Library Addition**: [Still active]
   - Sits between Grammar Library and Standard Library
   - Handles language-specific processing (English, French, German)
   - Enables multi-language support without changing core

### 4. **Fluent API Design**: [Still active]
   - Method chaining throughout (`.AddExit().AddItem()`)
   - Grammar definition using fluent syntax
   - Author-friendly world building

### 5. **Event-Driven Architecture**: [Still active]
   - Before/After events for all major actions
   - Delegate-based approach for flexibility
   - Allows for rules and dynamic behavior

### 6. **Domain + Behavior Approach**: [Still active]
   - Objects encapsulate their own behaviors
   - Container as separate class, not interface
   - Removal of procedural code patterns

### 7. **Parser-World Model Integration**: [Still active]
   - Parser validates against world model during parsing
   - Checks scope and disambiguation immediately
   - Returns standardized response objects

### 8. **Text Externalization**: [Still active]
   - All game text moved to Language classes
   - Separate Language project for localization
   - Template constants with parameter support

### 9. **Reflection-Based Loading**: [Still active]
   - Action handlers discovered via reflection
   - No manual registration required
   - Extensible without code changes

### 10. **Author-Centric Design**: [Still active]
   - API considers how IF authors think
   - Room-centric definition pattern
   - Connections defined near room definitions

## Key Evolution Patterns:

1. **Simplification Over Time**: 
   - Removed IGameContext abstraction
   - Direct use of components
   - Less abstraction, more clarity

2. **Consistent Fluent APIs**: 
   - Both ChatGPT and Claude converged on fluent interfaces
   - Shows this is a natural fit for IF

3. **Language Separation**: 
   - Claude sessions introduced Language Library concept
   - More sophisticated than ChatGPT approach
   - Better support for internationalization

4. **Event System Maturation**: 
   - Started with simple events
   - Evolved to Before/After pattern
   - Ended with delegate-based flexible system

## Dead Ends Avoided:
- Rules as Things (changed to event system)
- Complex abstraction layers (IGameContext removed)
- Procedural action handling (moved to domain behaviors)

## Next Steps:
Continue reviewing remaining Claude files to identify:
- When decisions were made to change approaches
- Additional patterns that emerged
- Final architectural state
