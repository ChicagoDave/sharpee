## Architecture Decisions Found:

### 1. World Model Service Layer Architecture (Phase 5)
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Introducing WorldModelService that wraps IFWorld with additional functionality
- **Query Builder Pattern**: Fluent API for querying entities with filters, operators, and spatial queries
- **Enhanced Scope Service**: Advanced scope calculations with pronoun resolution, recent entity tracking, and ambient conditions
- **Trait Type Centralization**: Moving from string-based to enum-based trait types

### 2. Testing Infrastructure (Phase 7)
- **Test Structure Pattern**: Consistent test patterns for traits including default creation, custom values, validation, behavior, and edge cases
- **Comprehensive Coverage Strategy**: Unit tests for each trait, integration tests for world model service, query builder tests, scope calculation tests, serialization tests

### 3. Type-to-Trait Migration Architecture (Phase 8)
- **Migration Strategy**: Clear path from type-based to trait-based system
- **Convenience Layers**:
  - EntityTemplates class with pre-defined trait combinations
  - EntityBuilder with fluent API for construction
  - Type-safe trait accessors on IFEntity
  - Trait bundles for common patterns
- **Builder Pattern**: Fluent API with automatic dependency handling and conflict resolution
- **Template System**: Pre-defined templates for common entity types (room, container, door, NPC, etc.)

## Key Patterns:
1. Service layer wrapping core functionality
2. Fluent APIs for complex operations
3. Template/builder patterns for object construction
4. Comprehensive test coverage patterns
5. Migration convenience layers to ease transitions
