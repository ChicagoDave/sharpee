# Sharpee Architecture Decisions - Batch 30

## File: 2025-05-25-12-28-17.json
**Topic**: Troubleshooting Refactored Sharpee Project

### Decision: Assessment of Refactoring State

**Context**: After using multiple tools (Claude Desktop, Windsurfer) that caused issues, needed to assess if the code was in a usable state or required rollback.

**Decision**: 
After thorough review, decided NOT to rollback. The refactoring produced good, clean code with only minor issues that can be fixed quickly.

**Rationale**: The IF-specific world model is much better than the generic approach and aligns with project goals. Issues found were minor (test utilities, missing exports) rather than fundamental architectural problems.

### Decision: IF-Specific World Model Architecture

**Context**: Review revealed the implemented IF-specific world model structure.

**Decision**: The world model architecture includes:
- **IFWorld class** - Main world model with entity management, location tracking, relationships
- **Entity types** - Room, Thing, Container, Supporter, Door, Person, Device, Player
- **Rich attributes** - Comprehensive IF properties (visibility, containers, light, openable, etc.)
- **Type safety** - Strong TypeScript types with guards and validation
- **Scope calculation** - Advanced lighting, visibility, and reachability calculations
- **Entity Factory** - Proper initialization of entities with all required fields

**Rationale**: This IF-specific approach is cleaner and more intuitive than the previous generic graph database approach.

### Decision: Test Implementation Issues

**Context**: Test file was out of sync with implementation.

**Decision**: Identified specific issues:
1. Test utilities don't initialize `relationships: {}` property
2. Test calls non-existent methods (`getRelationships()`, `getPlayerInventory()`)
3. Test/implementation mismatch

**Rationale**: These are minor issues that can be fixed quickly without architectural changes.

### Decision: Export Configuration Issue

**Context**: Main index.ts still exports old world-model implementations.

**Decision**: 
Need to update exports to include new IF-specific world model:
```typescript
export * from './world-model/if-entities/types';
export * from './world-model/if-world';
```

**Rationale**: Simple configuration fix to expose the new implementation.

### Decision: Entity Relationships Design

**Context**: Discovered that base Entity interface includes relationships property.

**Decision**: 
All entities have a `relationships: Record<string, EntityId[]>` property from the base Entity interface. The EntityFactory properly initializes this as an empty object.

**Rationale**: This design allows flexible relationship management while maintaining type safety.

### Decision: Scope Calculation System

**Context**: Review revealed comprehensive scope calculation implementation.

**Decision**: 
Implemented sophisticated IF logic for:
- Lighting calculations (darkness, light sources)
- Visibility rules (containers, concealment)
- Reachability calculations (open/closed containers)
- Knowledge tracking foundation

**Rationale**: This provides the foundation for realistic IF interactions and puzzles.

## Assessment Results

The review concluded that:
1. **Architecture**: Sound IF-first design with good separation of concerns
2. **Implementation**: Substantial, well-structured code
3. **Issues**: Minor and easily fixable
4. **Recommendation**: Fix the issues rather than rollback

## Quick Fixes Identified

1. Add `relationships: {}` to test entity creators
2. Update main index.ts exports
3. Fix or remove broken test methods
4. Create player entity in tests
