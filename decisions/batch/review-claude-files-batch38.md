**Title:** Assessing Interactive Fiction Platform Code  
**Key Decisions:** [!] Cold and rational code assessment

### Architectural Findings:
1. **Overall Architecture Assessment**
   - Well-layered architecture: core → stdlib → forge
   - Event-driven design with good separation of concerns
   - Strong type safety throughout
   - Language abstraction well-designed
   - Parser architecture sophisticated

2. **Identified Weaknesses**
   - Complexity creep - many abstraction layers
   - Missing integration layer between core and forge
   - Action system may be over-engineered (4 phases)
   - Inconsistent implementation state
   - Documentation gap

3. **Technical Concerns**
   - Performance implications of immutable state
   - Author experience questions
   - Missing critical features (save/restore, undo/redo)
   - Complex monorepo setup

4. **Key Recommendations**
   - Simplify action system to 2-3 phases
   - Complete forge layer with more builders
   - Create integration test suite
   - Performance profiling needed
   - Author-first documentation

5. **Strategic Verdict**
   - Risk of building perfect engine no one can use
   - Recommendation: Freeze core features, focus on forge layer, build example games, create documentation, simplify where possible

**Title:** Refactoring Sharpee's Interactive Fiction Platform  
**Key Decisions:** [!] Major architectural refactoring - separating IF-specific code from core

### Refactoring Analysis:
1. **Refactoring Goal**
   - Move IF world model from core to stdlib
   - Core should be IF-agnostic, only generic entity/world/state
   - Stdlib contains all IF-specific concepts

2. **Critical Finding - Build Errors**
   - Type name mismatch: code imports `IFEntityType` but enum is `CoreIFEntityType`
   - Same issue with `IFRelationship` vs `CoreIFRelationship`
   - Files affected:
     - if-world/if-world.ts
     - if-world/entity-factory.ts
     - if-world/scope-calculator.ts (likely)
     - __tests__/if-world.test.ts

3. **Duplicate Type Definitions**
   - Core has `CoreIFEntityType` enum
   - Stdlib has different `IFEntityType` enum with namespaced values
   - Need to reconcile into single definition

4. **Import Dependencies Mapped**
   - Core index.ts exports IF-specific types (with TODO comment)
   - IF world implementation in core depends on IF entities
   - No external packages import from core IF types (good)

5. **Immediate Action Required**
   - Fix import statements before refactoring
   - Change `IFEntityType` → `CoreIFEntityType` in affected files
   - Ensure build passes before starting move

**Title:** Refactoring Phase 2 Transition  
**Key Decisions:** [!] Moving to phase 2 of world model refactoring

### Phase 2 Plan:
1. **Phase 1 Completed**
   - Core types extracted to `packages/core/src/types/`
   - Created generic Entity, Relationship, Attribute types
   - Removed IF-specific enums from core types

2. **Phase 2 Goal**
   - Move entire world-model directory from core to stdlib
   - Includes all subdirectories: if-entities, if-world, implementations, types, tests

3. **Key Tasks**
   - Move files with `mv` command
   - Fix type names during move (CoreIFEntityType → IFEntityType)
   - Update imports to reference @sharpee/core/types
   - Clean up duplicate files in stdlib

**Title:** Tracking Phase 2 Project Progress  
**Key Decisions:** [!] Phase 2 partially completed with issues

### Status Assessment:
1. **Phase 2 Partially Complete**
   - World-model directory exists in both core and stdlib (duplicate)
   - Some files moved but not all
   - Multiple backup directories created (world-model-backup, world-model-old)

2. **Missing Files in Stdlib**
   - scope-calculator.ts (still in core)
   - location-tracker.ts (still in core)
   - All implementations/* files (still in core)
   - All types/* files under world-model (still in core)
   - Test files in __tests__ (still in core)

3. **Issues Found**
   - Incomplete migration - many files not moved
   - World-model directory should be completely removed from core
   - Backup directories need cleanup

4. **Next Steps Needed**
   - Complete the move of ALL remaining files
   - Remove world-model directory entirely from core
   - Clean up backup directories
   - Fix imports and continue with Phase 3
