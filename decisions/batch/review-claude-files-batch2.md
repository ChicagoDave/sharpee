## Major Architectural Decisions:

### 1. **World Model Classes Extension**: [Still active]
   - Room inherits from Thing with exit management
   - Animal as Thing with "animate" property
   - Person as Animal with "sentient" property
   - Fluent interface maintained throughout
   - Protected fields in base classes for inheritance

### 2. **Rules as Things**: [Changed]
   - Initial approach: Rules inherit from Thing and stored in graph
   - Had BeforeRule and AfterRule as subclasses
   - Ordered using string descriptions instead of numbers
   - Topological sort for rule ordering
   - Why: More intuitive for authors to say "rule X before rule Y"

### 3. **Event-Driven Rules Architecture**: [Changed/Evolved]
   - Moved from Rules as Things to event-driven approach
   - Alternative 1: Event-driven with RuleEvent class
   - Alternative 2: Rule Engine with DSL (WHEN/THEN syntax)
   - Why: More flexible and extensible than inheritance-based rules

### 4. **IFWorld Class Introduction**: [Abandoned]
   - Initially created as main interface between DataStore and IF logic
   - Implemented IGraphEventHandler
   - Later abandoned in favor of simpler approach
   - Why: Too complex for authors to understand

### 5. **Event Manager Pattern**: [Still active]
   - Implements IGraphEventHandler interface
   - Processes graph events and matches to IF events
   - All event data stored in Data Store as nodes
   - Why: Maintains data store requirement while providing IF abstraction

### 6. **Event Parsing Approach**: [Still active]
   - Parse graph events for details
   - Compare to author-created IF Events
   - Execute author-provided functions
   - Why: More author-friendly than direct graph manipulation

### 7. **Condition Evaluation**: [Evolved]
   - Started with complex RuleCondition classes
   - Evolved to string-based conditions like "Gold Bar in Kitchen"
   - Simplified to natural language patterns
   - Why: Authors need readable, writable rules in IF style

### 8. **Handler Storage**: [Changed]
   - Initially tried to store Action delegates directly
   - Changed to storing handler code as strings
   - Why: Data Store can't serialize delegates/functions

## Key Evolution Patterns:

1. **Simplification for Authors**:
   - Moved away from complex inheritance hierarchies
   - Adopted more natural language approaches
   - Hid graph implementation details

2. **Event-Driven Over State-Based**:
   - Shifted from state-checking rules to event-driven rules
   - Better integration with DataStore events
   - More efficient than constant state polling

3. **String-Based Rule Definition**:
   - Evolution from code-based to string-based conditions
   - Enables potential DSL development
   - Easier for non-programmers

4. **Data Store Compliance**:
   - Constant reminder that ALL data must be in graph
   - Led to creative solutions for storing behavior
   - Influenced move to string-based handlers

## Dead Ends Avoided:
- IFWorld class as central orchestrator (too complex)
- Storing functions/delegates in graph (not serializable)
- Complex rule condition parsing with parameters
- Numeric ordering of rules

## Important Insights:
1. Author readability is paramount - "horrible" code is code authors can't read
2. The translation layer must hide graph complexity
3. Event-driven is better than polling for IF
4. Natural language patterns work better than structured syntax
5. Everything must be storable in the graph data store

## Architectural Direction:
The system is moving toward:
- Event-driven rule processing
- Natural language rule definition
- Complete data persistence in graph
- Minimal complexity exposed to authors
- Fluent interfaces maintained throughout
