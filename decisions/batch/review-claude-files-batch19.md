**Title:** Resolving Build Errors in Stdlib for Sharpee IF Platform

### Context:
This session continues from the previous one, now focusing on build errors in the stdlib package. The errors indicate issues with imports, missing types, and interface mismatches.

### Build Errors Encountered:
1. Import path errors in core-imports.ts (parser types, extension types)
2. Missing 'accessible' property on objects
3. Missing 'context' property on CommandResult
4. String indexing issues with direction systems
5. Missing EXIT property on RelationshipType
6. Incomplete ParsedCommand objects in take-handler

### Decisions Found:

1. **EXIT Relationship Type Added**: [Still Active]
   - Why: Movement system needs EXIT relationships for navigation
   - Added EXIT = 'exit' to RelationshipType enum
   - This enables proper exit-based movement between locations

2. **CommandResult Metadata Pattern**: [Still Active]
   - Why: Need to pass updated context between command executions
   - Instead of adding 'context' property, use metadata.updatedContext
   - Maintains backward compatibility while extending functionality

3. **Type Safety for Direction Systems**: [Still Active]
   - Why: TypeScript strict mode requires proper indexing
   - Use type assertions (as keyof typeof MOVEMENT_SYSTEMS)
   - Ensures type safety when accessing dynamic properties

4. **Parser Types Location**: [Clarification]
   - Parser types are in parser/core/types.ts not parser/types.ts
   - Reflects the modular organization of the parser system

### Key Technical Details:
- Fixed import paths to match actual file structure
- Added proper type assertions for string indexing
- Updated handlers to use metadata pattern for context passing
- Added EXIT to RelationshipType for navigation support

### Notable Patterns:
- Use of metadata field in CommandResult for extensibility
- Type assertions to satisfy TypeScript's strict type checking
- Maintaining separation between core types and implementations

### Implementation Details:
- Core-imports.ts serves as a centralized import point for stdlib
- Handlers use BaseCommandHandler for common functionality
- Movement system supports multiple navigation paradigms (compass, nautical, clock)

### Status:
This session successfully addressed TypeScript compilation errors in the stdlib package. The fixes maintain architectural integrity while ensuring type safety. The session shows active development with the TypeScript migration complete and focus on building the standard library.
