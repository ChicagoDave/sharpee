**Title:** Resolving Build Errors in Sharpee Project

### Context:
This session occurred after the TypeScript migration was already complete. The project structure shows packages using TypeScript with lerna for monorepo management. The user encountered build errors and asked for help fixing them.

### Build Errors Encountered:
1. Type error in text-processor.ts with string argument
2. Missing EntityManager export in game-context.ts
3. Multiple re-export conflicts in index.ts (EventEmitter, EventListener, createEvent, etc.)

### Decisions Found:

**None** - This was a debugging/fixing session rather than an architectural decision session. The conversation shows:
- Claude attempting to diagnose and fix TypeScript compilation errors
- Investigation of the project structure and imports
- No new architectural decisions were made
- Session appears to have ended before fixes were completed

### Key Technical Details:
- The project was already using TypeScript at this point (packages structure confirms)
- Lerna was being used for monorepo management
- The errors suggest some refactoring was in progress with exports being reorganized
- The session reveals the existence of:
  - Event system with EventEmitter pattern
  - Extension system with ExtensionRegistry
  - World model with EntityManager
  - Text processing system

### Notable Patterns:
- The errors indicate potential architectural cleanup was happening (removing duplicate exports)
- Game-context.ts reference suggests it may have been moved or removed as part of refactoring
- The session shows the platform was already well into TypeScript implementation

### Status:
This appears to be a mid-development debugging session with no architectural decisions. The session ended abruptly (only 2 messages) before the issues were resolved.
