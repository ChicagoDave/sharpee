# Sharpee IF Platform - Work Summary for Next Session

## Overview
We've been working on the Sharpee Interactive Fiction platform, a TypeScript-based IF system with a three-layer architecture. The project uses a trait-based entity system inspired by ECS patterns.

## Current Status: Phase 2 Complete, Phase 3 In Progress

### Phase 2: World Model Implementation âœ… COMPLETE

Successfully implemented the core world model infrastructure in `/packages/world-model/src/world/`:

1. **IWorldModel Interface** (`IWorldModel.ts`)
   - Defines complete world model API with all methods
   - Supporting interfaces: IWorldState, IWorldConfig, IFindOptions, IContentsOptions

2. **WorldModel Class** (`WorldModel.ts`)
   - Full implementation of IWorldModel interface
   - Entity management (create, get, remove, etc.)
   - Spatial management with validation
   - State management
   - Query operations (findByTrait, getVisible, getInScope)
   - Relationship tracking
   - Utility methods (getTotalWeight, wouldCreateLoop, findPath)
   - JSON persistence (toJSON, loadJSON)

3. **SpatialIndex** (`SpatialIndex.ts`)
   - Efficient O(1) parent-child relationship tracking
   - Support for ancestry/descendant queries
   - JSON serialization support

4. **VisibilityBehavior** (`VisibilityBehavior.ts`)
   - Complete visibility system
   - Handles darkness, light sources, containers
   - Line of sight through transparent/opaque containers

5. **Infrastructure Updates**
   - Added `weight` getter to IFEntity
   - Added `hasTrait` alias method for backwards compatibility
   - Updated main index to export world module

### Phase 3: StdLib Updates (IN PROGRESS)

#### âœ… Completed Service Updates
1. **InventoryService** - Now uses IWorldModel
   - Updated to use world model's methods (wouldCreateLoop, getTotalWeight, etc.)
   - Container capacity checks pass world model to behaviors

2. **VisibilityService** - Simplified to use IWorldModel
   - Delegates to world model's visibility methods
   - Much cleaner implementation

3. **ScopeService** - NEW service created
   - Entity resolution for parser
   - "all" resolution for different action contexts
   - Best match finding for entity names

#### âœ… Completed Action Updates
1. **GoingAction**
   - Added darkness checking before movement
   - Proper door state validation
   - Added TOO_DARK failure reason

2. **TakingAction**
   - Updated capacity checks to use world model
   - Better error handling

3. **PuttingAction** - NEW action created
   - Handles PUT IN vs PUT ON
   - Full validation (capacity, loops, reachability)
   - Created command definitions

#### ðŸ”² Remaining Phase 3 Tasks
- Update OpeningAction
- Update ClosingAction
- Update LockingAction
- Update UnlockingAction
- Create LightAction (LIGHT/EXTINGUISH)
- Update parser for scope resolution
- Parser support for "PUT X IN Y" vs "PUT X ON Y"

## Key Design Principles Maintained

1. **Layer Separation**: Core â†’ World Model â†’ StdLib â†’ Forge
2. **Traits = Pure Data**: No methods except getters/setters
3. **Behaviors = Static Logic**: All logic in static methods
4. **No Hardcoded Strings**: Language separation maintained
5. **Extension Ready**: Core only has universal IF concepts

## File Locations

- World Model Implementation: `/packages/world-model/src/world/`
- Service Updates: `/packages/stdlib/src/services/`
- Action Updates: `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/`
- Constants: `/packages/stdlib/src/constants/`

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining Phase 3 actions (Opening, Closing, Locking, Unlocking)
2. Create LightAction for light source manipulation
3. Update parser to use ScopeService
4. Begin Phase 4: Testing & Integration

## Important Notes

- Unit tests are on hold until we have a working story
- The world model is feature-complete and ready for use
- All services now properly use IWorldModel interface
- Extension system design is still pending (after core completion)

## Technical Decisions Made

1. Used IWorldModel directly instead of a service wrapper
2. Created ScopeService as a separate service rather than part of parser
3. Added PUT_IN and PUT_ON as separate events for clarity
4. Visibility is now handled entirely by world model, not duplicated in services

The foundation is solid and we're making good progress through the stdlib updates!
