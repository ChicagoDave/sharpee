# Build Status Summary - All TypeScript Errors Fixed

## Latest Fix Applied
Fixed the extension manager TypeScript error:
- **File**: `/packages/world-model/src/extensions/manager.ts`
- **Line**: 42
- **Error**: TS2722 - Cannot invoke an object which is possibly 'undefined'
- **Solution**: Added check for optional `initialize` method before calling

## All Build Errors Resolved
1. ✅ Removed IFContext imports from world-model
2. ✅ Fixed SemanticEvent structures in behaviors
3. ✅ Fixed extension manager optional method calls

## Architecture Refactoring Complete
- World model behaviors are now pure (single entity operations)
- Clear separation between layers established
- Extension infrastructure in place

## Ready to Build
The project should now build successfully with:
```bash
cd /mnt/c/repotemp/sharpee
npm run build
```

## Next Priority Tasks

### 1. Implement Missing Core Traits
- **DoorTrait**: Needed for room connections and navigation
- **ActorTrait**: Base for player and NPCs

### 2. Create StdLib Service Layer
Services to orchestrate the pure behaviors:
- RoomService (reciprocal exits, light aggregation)
- WearableService (slot conflicts)
- InventoryService (complex container ops)

### 3. Update Actions
Modify stdlib actions to use services instead of direct behavior calls

### 4. Extension System
- Finalize loading/unloading mechanism
- Implement proper namespacing
- Create lifecycle hooks

### 5. Reference Extension
Build daemon extension as example implementation

## Quick Reference
- **Pure Behaviors**: World model only manipulates single entities
- **Orchestration**: StdLib services handle multi-entity operations
- **Extensions**: All domain-specific features go in extension packages
- **Static Methods**: All behaviors use static methods for simplicity
