    <h2>What is Parser IF?</h2>
    <p>Interactive fiction is a form of storytelling where you play by typing commands in natural language. Instead of clicking buttons or selecting from menus, you type what you want to do:</p>
    <div class="command-examples">
      <code>go north</code>
      <code>take the brass lantern</code>
      <code>open the trapdoor</code>
      <code>put the jeweled egg in the trophy case</code>
    </div>
    <p>The game understands your words, figures out what you mean, and describes what happens next. It's part puzzle game, part novel, part conversation with a world that reacts to everything you do.</p>
    <p>Parser IF has a long history stretching back to the 1970s &mdash; Colossal Cave Adventure, Zork, the Infocom catalog &mdash; but the form is very much alive. Modern authors continue to push it in new directions, from literary experiments to intricate puzzle worlds.</p>

    <h2>Why Sharpee?</h2>
    <p>Classic IF development tools were built decades ago. They work, but they carry the weight of their era &mdash; custom languages, limited tooling, and architectures that resist modern development practices.</p>
    <p>Sharpee takes a different approach. It's built from the ground up in TypeScript, designed around composable traits, modern technical architecture, and a clean separation between game logic and natural language. Authors write in a real programming language with real tooling &mdash; type checking, IDE support, package management, testing frameworks.</p>
    <p>The engine handles the hard parts: parsing natural language commands, managing a rich world model of objects and their relationships, coordinating complex multi-phase actions, and keeping NPCs acting autonomously. Authors focus on crafting their world and story.</p>
    <p>Sharpee ships with standard actions, a full English parser and support for other language implementations, support for darkness and sensory restrictions, timed events, container logic, and everything else you'd expect from a mature IF platform. It runs in the browser and on the desktop via the Zifmia game runner.</p>
    <p>It's currently in beta, being battle-tested against one of the most complex text adventures ever made: a full port of Mainframe Zork's Great Underground Empire with several new stories in the works by Sharpee's creator, David Cornelson.</p>
