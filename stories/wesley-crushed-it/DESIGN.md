# Wesley Crushed It

## An Interactive Fiction Design Document

---

## High Concept

*Being John Malkovich* meets Star Trek fandom meets internet meme archaeology.

The player discovers a portal—location TBD, but probably something absurd like behind a panel at a convention center or inside a Wesley Crusher action figure—that leads into the layered identities of Wil Wheaton. Not the man himself, but the *idea* of him: the nested personas, the memes, the parasocial projections, the fictional characters, all stacked on top of each other like sedimentary rock.

The goal isn't to "become" Wil Wheaton. It's to understand what "Wil Wheaton" even *means* when a person becomes a living meme, a self-aware punchline, and a genuinely decent human being all at once.

---

## Thematic Core

**Central Question:** When someone becomes a symbol, what happens to the person underneath?

**Secondary Themes:**
- The gap between who we are and who the internet decides we are
- Nostalgia as a trap
- The performance of authenticity
- Redemption arcs (Wesley Crusher's in-universe, Wheaton's cultural rehabilitation)
- "Don't be a dick" as both philosophy and impossible standard

## The Identity Layers

The game is structured as a descent (or ascent?) through distinct zones, each representing a different facet of the Wheaton gestalt.

### Layer 1: The Convention Floor
**Aesthetic:** Fluorescent lights, carpet patterns, the smell of desperation and joy
**Tone:** Warm, chaotic, slightly overwhelming

The entry point. You're a convention attendee who stumbles into something weird. This layer establishes the "real world" frame and introduces the portal mechanic. NPCs include cosplayers, autograph seekers, and a suspicious vendor selling knockoff memorabilia.

The portal is hidden in plain sight—perhaps a photo op backdrop of the Enterprise bridge, and when you sit in the captain's chair (Wesley never got to sit there, of course), you fall through.

### Layer 2: The Enterprise-D
**Aesthetic:** Beige carpets, swooshing doors, lens flares
**Tone:** Earnest, slightly sterile, punctuated by cringe

You are Wesley Crusher. Or you're inhabiting him. Or you're watching him from just behind his eyes. The distinction matters and the game should be coy about clarifying it.

This layer is about the *original sin*: being the kid genius that 1980s TV thought audiences wanted. Every interaction is shadowed by the knowledge that people hated this character. NPCs include:
- **Picard:** Distant, paternal, occasionally warm, always slightly irritated
- **Riker:** Performatively supportive in a way that feels hollow
- **The Traveler:** The one person who sees Wesley's potential, but also kind of creepy about it?
- **Background crew members:** They don't say "shut up, Wesley" but you can *feel* them thinking it
- **Counselor Troi:** The empath. The feelings person. Her only line, ever, is "Shut up, Wesley." No matter the context. No matter how inappropriate. She says it during red alerts, during tender moments, during silence. She is the meme made flesh.

**Key puzzle concept:** You must accomplish something genuinely helpful, but every time you try to explain your solution, you get cut off or dismissed. The puzzle is figuring out how to save the ship *without speaking*.

### Layer 3: Apartment 4A
**Aesthetic:** Sitcom lighting, laugh track echoes, aggressive nerd signifiers
**Tone:** Arch, self-aware, slightly mean

Now you're "Evil Wil Wheaton"—the fictionalized version from The Big Bang Theory who's a smug jerk playing himself as a smug jerk. The recursion is dizzying. You're playing a game about a guy playing a version of himself that's playing the opposite of himself.

This layer interrogates the idea of "leaning into the joke." Is it empowering to reclaim your narrative by exaggerating it? Or is it just another cage?

NPCs speak entirely in sitcom rhythms. There's a laugh track that triggers at odd moments. Sheldon is present but you can never quite look directly at him—he's always in your peripheral vision, like a sleep paralysis demon with a Green Lantern t-shirt.

**Key puzzle concept:** A social manipulation challenge where you must be exactly dickish enough to maintain your "evil" persona while secretly helping someone. Too nice and you break character; too mean and you become the mask.

### Layer 4: The Forum Depths
**Aesthetic:** Early-2000s web design, blinking GIFs, walls of text
**Tone:** Archaeological, melancholic, uncomfortably parasocial

You descend into the substrate where memes are born. This is the collective unconscious of Wheaton discourse: the flame wars, the "Shut up Wesley" supercuts, the first tentative posts where someone said "actually, Wil Wheaton seems like a pretty cool guy."

This layer is non-linear and maze-like. Forum threads branch and loop. You can read ancient arguments that feel urgent and pointless simultaneously. The NPCs are usernames—faceless but opinionated.

**Key puzzle concept:** You must assemble a complete picture of "the discourse" by navigating contradictory threads. The solution involves recognizing that all perspectives are simultaneously true and incomplete.

Somewhere in here, you find the origin point: the moment someone first typed "Wheaton's Law: Don't be a dick." It should feel sacred and silly at the same time.

### Layer 5: The Tabletop
**Aesthetic:** A well-lit game table, dice, miniatures, the warm glow of friendship
**Tone:** Genuine, a little twee, self-consciously wholesome

TableTop Wil. This is the redemption-arc zone—the version that rebuilt his public image by being enthusiastically, unapologetically nerdy in a way that invited people in rather than pushing them away.

But there's something underneath the warmth. The pressure to perform joy. The awareness that this kindness is also a brand. Is it still authentic if you're monetizing it? (Yes, probably. But the question lingers.)

The game-within-a-game mechanic lives here. You're playing a board game, and the board game is also a narrative, and your moves in the game affect the surrounding reality.

**Key puzzle concept:** A dice-rolling segment where the outcomes seem random but are secretly deterministic—the game is rigged, but only in the sense that all games are rigged, because someone designed them. The puzzle is realizing that "the dice" are a metaphor for the illusion of control.

### Layer 6: Castle Rock, 1959
**Aesthetic:** Black and white (or sepia), rural Oregon, summer heat
**Tone:** Suddenly, devastatingly sincere

Stand By Me. Everyone forgets Stand By Me.

Before Wesley, before any of it, there was Gordie Lachance's friend in a movie about grief and boyhood and the last summer before everything changes. This layer is the hidden foundation—the version of young Wil Wheaton that wasn't a punchline, that was just a kid in a genuinely great film that made people cry.

The tonal shift should be jarring. No laugh tracks. No memes. Just the railroad tracks and the long walk and the body that shouldn't be there.

**Key puzzle concept:** Almost no puzzles. Just walking and remembering. Maybe a single choice that doesn't seem important but determines the ending.

### Layer 7: The Substrate
**Aesthetic:** Abstract, liminal, the space between identities
**Tone:** Quiet, philosophical, slightly unsettling

The deepest layer. All the personas exist here simultaneously, overlapping and contradicting. This is where the game asks its central question and refuses to answer it cleanly.

Is there a "real" Wil Wheaton underneath all this? Does it matter? When we build identities—public and private—are we discovering ourselves or constructing ourselves? Is there a difference?

The final confrontation (with yourself? with the idea of self?) happens here.

## Core Mechanics

### The Wheaton's Law System
Every choice is secretly evaluated against "Don't be a dick." The game never shows you the criteria or your score. You just notice that some doors open and others close. Some NPCs warm to you; others turn away.

Late in the game, you can find fragments that hint at how the system works, but the full algorithm is never revealed. This is intentional. "Don't be a dick" is a heuristic, not a rulebook.

### The Shut Up Mechanic
Periodically, the game offers you a chance to speak—to explain yourself, to share your brilliant insight, to interject. Choosing to speak almost always makes things worse. The puzzle is learning when to stay silent.

This should feel frustrating at first. The player will want to say the smart thing, the helpful thing. But part of the game's message is about the value of listening, of not needing to be the hero of every scene.

### Identity Bleed
As you move between layers, aspects of other personas start leaking in. Wesley starts making sitcom quips. Evil Wil has moments of sincere vulnerability. Forum avatars speak in Picard's cadence.

This can be tracked with a hidden variable (call it "coherence" or "integration" or something). Low coherence means the boundaries are breaking down. Whether this is good or bad depends on interpretation.

### The Recursive Game
In the Tabletop layer and possibly others, you play games-within-games. These should be mechanically simple but narratively loaded. The outcomes ripple outward.

## Puzzle Sketches

### "The Boy Who Saved the Ship"
**Layer:** Enterprise-D
**Setup:** A classic Wesley scenario—you've noticed something the adults missed. A plasma conduit is about to overload. You have the solution.
**Complication:** Every time you try to explain, something interrupts you. The red alert siren. Picard's monologue. A priority transmission.
**Solution:** Stop trying to explain. Just fix it. Reroute the conduit yourself, silently. No credit. No acknowledgment. But the ship doesn't explode.
**Lesson:** Sometimes heroism is invisible.

### "The Bowling Alley Gambit"
**Layer:** Apartment 4A
**Setup:** You're in a competition with Sheldon (who you still can't look at directly). The game is bowling, but the stakes are social—winner gets to humiliate the loser on a podcast.
**Complication:** Your "evil" persona demands you cheat. But cheating would actually hurt someone who doesn't deserve it—a peripheral character with genuine feelings.
**Solution:** Lose on purpose, but do it in a way that looks accidental. Maintain the persona while subverting its cruelty.
**Lesson:** Masks can be used strategically.

### "The Thread That Wouldn't Die"
**Layer:** Forum Depths
**Setup:** A flame war from 2003 is still going. The participants have been arguing the same points for what feels like centuries.
**Complication:** Both sides make valid points. Both sides are also being dicks about it.
**Solution:** Don't resolve the argument. Instead, find the single post, buried deep, where someone changed their mind. That post is the key.
**Lesson:** Most discourse is performance. Genuine shifts are rare and precious.

### "The Dice Don't Lie"
**Layer:** Tabletop
**Setup:** A climactic game moment. You need a specific roll to save your party.
**Complication:** You realize the dice are weighted. You will always roll what the narrative needs.
**Solution:** Roll anyway. Or refuse to roll. Or point out that the dice are fake. Each choice leads somewhere different.
**Lesson:** Authenticity within artificial structures is still authenticity.

### "The Body"
**Layer:** Castle Rock
**Setup:** You know what you're walking toward. You've always known.
**Complication:** None, really. Just the walk. Just the memory.
**Solution:** Get there. Look. Don't look away.
**Lesson:** Some things don't have puzzles. They just have presence.

## Endings

### The Integration Ending
You've achieved high coherence. The layers merge. Wesley, Evil Wil, TableTop Wil, the kid from Stand By Me—they're all just facets of someone trying to figure out who he is. You emerge from the portal changed, or maybe just more aware that change is constant.

### The Fragmentation Ending
Low coherence. The personas can't reconcile. You're stuck in the Substrate, flickering between identities, never quite landing. It's not necessarily bad—some people live like this. It's just... ongoing.

### The Exit Ending
At any point, you can try to leave. The portal back to the convention floor is always technically available. But if you leave early, you take some of the layers with you. NPCs at the con start talking like they're in a sitcom. You see forum threads overlaid on their faces. Did you escape, or did you just bring the weirdness back?

### The Malkovich Ending
You stay too long. You become incorporated into the Wheaton-space permanently. Not as Wil Wheaton, but as another layer—another persona for future explorers to navigate. Your identity becomes part of the sediment.

## Tone Notes

- **Funny but not mean:** The memes and the cringe are acknowledged, but the game should fundamentally like its subject. We're not punching down at Wesley Crusher; we're exploring why we ever thought we needed to.

- **Weird but grounded:** The surrealism should feel earned, not random. Every strange element connects to something real about identity, fandom, or performance.

- **Earnest about earnestness:** The game's thesis is probably something like "being genuine is hard and brave and sometimes embarrassing, and that's okay." Don't undercut this with too much irony.

- **Gen X melancholy:** There's a thread of "we were promised the future and got this instead" running through Wheaton's generation. The game can touch this without wallowing.

## Technical Considerations

### Sharpee Suitability
This would be a fairly text-heavy, choice-driven piece—well-suited to a Sharpee implementation. Some considerations:

- **Layer transitions** could use Sharpee's scene/location system
- **The coherence variable** needs careful tracking across layers
- **Forum Depths** might benefit from a more experimental link structure
- **Dice-rolling segment** needs randomization (or pseudo-randomization)
- **Visual styling** could shift per layer (CSS theming)

### Scope Estimate
This is a medium-to-large IF project:
- 6-7 distinct zones with different mechanics
- Multiple endings
- Significant variable tracking
- Probably 15,000-25,000 words minimum for a satisfying implementation

Could be scoped down by cutting layers (Tabletop and Forum Depths are most cuttable) or by making it more linear.

## Open Questions

1. **Who is the player character?** Convention attendee? Unnamed protagonist? Does it matter?

2. **Does Wil Wheaton (the actual person) exist in this world?** Is he the substrate beneath the layers, or is he just another layer?

3. **How explicit should the Being John Malkovich parallels be?** Direct homage? Subtle nods? Full parody?

4. **Is there a villain?** The memes themselves? The parasocial gaze? Twitter?

5. **Legal considerations?** This is clearly transformative/parody, but worth thinking about how much direct quotation or likeness usage happens.
