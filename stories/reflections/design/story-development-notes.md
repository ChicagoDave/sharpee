# Reflections - Story Development Notes

## Core Concept
A three-character tragedy involving mirror magic, family secrets, and a hidden magical society.

## The Three Characters

### The Thief
- Professional art thief using Blood of Silver for "impossible" heists
- Father of The Girl (doesn't know)
- Married into the secret society 20 years ago
- Uses his deceased wife's family magic for crime
- Living in despair and guilt

### The Girl (The Young Woman)
- Daughter of The Thief and The Old Man's daughter
- Has both Blood of Silver and Blood of Moon (inherited)
- Raised in secret by her "dead" mother
- Doesn't know about the society initially
- Discovering her heritage through mirror visions

### The Old Man
- Grandfather of The Girl (doesn't know)
- Father of The Thief's "deceased" wife
- Has Blood of Silver (and possibly Blood of Stars for foresight)
- On a 20-year vengeance quest
- His wife opposes his obsession: "What's done is done"

## The Blood Magic System

### Blood of the Silver
- Connect mirrors to create portals
- Can sense other users through same mirrors
- Leave "signatures" or "tracers" on mirrors
- All three main characters have this power
- Hereditary through bloodlines

### Blood of the Moon
- Grants invisibility
- The Girl has this (inherited from mother's side)

### Blood of the Earth
- Resurrection/preservation power
- The mother had this (unknown to everyone)
- Saved her life when buried alive
- Extremely rare

### Blood of the Stars (implied)
- Foresight/knowledge
- The Old Man may have this

## The Hidden Backstory

### The Original Tragedy
1. The Thief and wife caught during heist
2. Wife shot and "dies" in his arms
3. Thief buries her without casket in secret cemetery
4. Old Man arrives too late, Thief escapes through mirror
5. Old Man vows vengeance

### The Secret Resurrection
- Wife was pregnant and had Blood of Earth
- Earth cocooned and healed her
- She awakened months later with fractured memories
- Gave birth to The Girl and raised her in hiding
- Never fully recovered memories, kept past secret

## The Secret Society

### The Parisian Bloodlines
- Thriving but hidden community in Paris
- Very closed, secretive society
- Marry within bloodlines to preserve powers
- The Thief was an outsider who married in
- They suspect The Thief but can't prove it
- Monitor through mirror networks

### Society Rules & Culture
- Powers kept absolutely secret
- The Thief's crimes violate sacred laws
- Using family magic for crime is ultimate betrayal
- The society watches but doesn't intervene

## Story Structure

### Perspective Switching Mechanic
- Story-scripted switches between characters
- Start with The Thief, then The Girl, then The Old Man
- Final act: rapid switching every turn
- Player experiences each character's viewpoint
- Directed switching, not player-controlled

### Act Structure

**Act 1: The Heist**
- The Thief's museum robbery (opening scene)
- The Girl following/stealing from The Thief
- The Old Man tracking The Thief

**Act 2: The Investigation**
- Characters discovering connections
- The Girl learning about her powers
- Revelations through mirror visions

**Act 3: The Convergence**
- Rapid perspective switching
- All three in same location
- Truth revealed through confrontation
- Player choices determine ending

## The Four Endings

### All Three Die (TRAGEDY)
- Complete failure, bloodline ends
- Paris mourns the loss
- The wife/mother left alone

### Two Die (SACRIFICE)
- One survivor carries the legacy
- Paris offers sanctuary
- Bittersweet resolution

### One Dies (REDEMPTION)
- Noble sacrifice saves the others
- Family reunited through loss
- Paris honors the fallen

### All Three Live (RECONCILIATION)
- Truth revealed, family reunited
- Return to Paris together
- Bloodline strengthened

## Key Dramatic Revelations

### The Family Connection
- The Girl is The Thief's daughter
- The Old Man is her grandfather
- They all share the same rare power

### The Mother Lives
- The wife survived through Blood of Earth
- She's been alive for 20 years
- Raised The Girl in secret

### The Society's Interest
- They've been watching all along
- The Thief has been their quarry
- The Girl could reunite the bloodlines

## Implementation Notes for Sharpee

### Mirror Mechanics
```javascript
// Multiple users can conflict over same mirror
// Signatures and tracers can be detected
// Network of connected mirrors across cities
```

### Perspective System
```javascript
// Each character has different knowledge states
// Same events seen differently by each
// Information asymmetry drives puzzle-solving
```

### The Opening Scene (from screenplay)
- Art Institute of Chicago heist
- Reflective suit and bright light (blinds cameras)
- Professional, methodical approach
- Someone steals from The Thief (The Girl)

### Chicago Setting
- Art Institute (heist location)
- Abandoned apartment (safe house)
- Garage with hidden mirror
- Thief's high-rise apartment
