title: Implicit Take for Reading (ADR-104 - Inference Disabled)
story: dungeo
description: Test implicit take for reading action (inference feature is disabled)

---

# Note: ADR-104 implicit inference has been intentionally disabled.
# Pronouns now always refer to the pronoun context, even if the entity
# doesn't meet action requirements. This makes pronouns predictable.

# Open the mailbox to set pronoun context
> open mailbox
[OK: contains "open"]

# "read it" where "it" = mailbox - should fail (mailbox not readable)
# No inference happens - pronoun respects player intent
> read it
[OK: contains "nothing written"]

# Verify pronoun still refers to mailbox
> examine it
[OK: contains "mailbox"]

# Explicit "read mailbox" should also fail (not readable)
> read mailbox
[OK: contains "nothing written"]

# Take the leaflet explicitly first
> take leaflet
[OK: contains "take leaflet"]

# Now reading leaflet works (already holding it)
> read leaflet
[OK: contains "DUNGEO"]

# Drop leaflet to test implicit take
> drop leaflet
[OK: contains "Dropped"]

# "read leaflet" should do implicit take (not holding, but in scope)
> read leaflet
[OK: contains "first taking"]
[OK: contains "DUNGEO"]

# Reading again should NOT do implicit take (already holding)
> read leaflet
[OK: contains "DUNGEO"]
