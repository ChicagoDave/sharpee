description: Test implicit inference - "read it" when "it" = mailbox should infer leaflet

---

# Open the mailbox to set pronoun context
> open mailbox
[OK: contains "open"]
[EVENT: true, type="if.event.opened"]

# "read it" where "it" = mailbox (not readable)
# Should infer the leaflet (only readable thing in scope) and read it
> read it
[OK: contains "DUNGEO"]
[EVENT: true, type="action.success"]

# Verify pronoun still refers to mailbox (inference doesn't change pronoun context)
> examine it
[OK: contains "mailbox"]

# Explicit "read mailbox" should NOT infer - should fail
> read mailbox
[EVENT: true, type="action.blocked"]
