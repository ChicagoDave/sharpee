story: dungeo
description: Verify disambiguation prompts when multiple items match

---

# Test 1: Two keys both match "key" - should trigger disambiguation
> gdt
[OK: contains "GDT"]

> tk skeleton key
[OK: contains "Taken"]

> tk small key
[OK: contains "Taken"]

> ex
[OK: contains "Returning"]

# "drop key" should trigger disambiguation since both match
> drop key
[OK: contains "Which do you mean"]

# Verify both keys still in inventory (disambiguation didn't execute)
> inventory
[OK: contains "skeleton key"]
[OK: contains "small key"]

# Test 2: Two books both match "book" - should trigger disambiguation
> gdt
[OK: contains "GDT"]

> tk guidebook
[OK: contains "Taken"]

> tk purple book
[OK: contains "Taken"]

> ex
[OK: contains "Returning"]

# "examine book" should trigger disambiguation
> examine book
[OK: contains "Which do you mean"]

# Test 3: Single match should NOT trigger disambiguation
# Only one mailbox exists - should work directly
> examine mailbox
[OK: contains "mailbox"]

# Only one mat exists
> examine mat
[OK: contains "mat"]
