# Cloak of Darkness Implementation Summary

## What We've Created

A complete Sharpee implementation of the classic "Cloak of Darkness" IF demo game.

### Story Structure

```typescript
CloakOfDarknessStory implements Story {
  config = {
    title: "Cloak of Darkness",
    language: "en-us",  // Will load @sharpee/lang-en-us
    ...
  }
  
  initializeWorld(world) {
    // Creates 4 rooms: Foyer, Cloakroom, Bar, Outside
    // Creates objects: velvet cloak, brass hook, message
    // Sets up initial state
  }
  
  createPlayer(world) {
    // Creates player with ACTOR, CONTAINER traits
  }
}
```

### Key Features

1. **Rooms**:
   - **Foyer**: Starting location, well-lit
   - **Cloakroom**: Has a brass hook (supporter)
   - **Bar**: Dark room with the message
   - **Outside**: Can't leave (weather is bad)

2. **Objects**:
   - **Velvet Cloak**: Wearable, absorbs light when carried
   - **Brass Hook**: Supporter (can hang cloak on it)
   - **Message**: Readable, in sawdust on bar floor

3. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Bar is dark when carrying the cloak
   - Entering bar in darkness disturbs the sawdust
   - Message becomes garbled after disturbances
   - Win by reading undisturbed message

4. **Dynamic Content**:
   - Message description changes based on darkness/disturbance
   - Message text gets progressively garbled
   - Custom event handler tracks movement into dark bar

### Technical Implementation

- Uses Sharpee trait system (ROOM, IDENTITY, WEARABLE, etc.)
- Implements Story interface from @sharpee/engine
- Declares language as "en-us" for localization
- Custom event handlers for game logic
- Dynamic description functions

### Usage

```typescript
import { createEngineWithStory } from '@sharpee/engine';
import { story } from '@sharpee/story-cloak-of-darkness';

const engine = await createEngineWithStory(story);
engine.start();

// Play the game
await engine.executeTurn('look');
await engine.executeTurn('west');
await engine.executeTurn('hang cloak on hook');
// etc.
```

This demonstrates a complete, working Sharpee story with all the essential IF elements!
