# Chapter I - The Alley and Mercenary Introduction

## 4. Alley

**Description**: 
This narrow alley is tucked away between a wooden storehouse on one side and the canvas wall of a stall keeper's tent on the other. It serves primarily as somewhere out-of-the-way for stall keepers to sweep their garbage into, so it's not exactly the most pleasant-smelling place in all of Miradan, but at least no one is likely to bother you here. You can leave to the southwest.

### Object: Crates
- **Initial Appearance:** Several crates are stacked up against the back wall of the alley.
- **Description**: Just ordinary wooden crates, used by merchants throughout Miradan to store and ship goods. There are scores more just like these to be found all over the market.
- **Command [taking or pushing crates]:** Oof! What's in these things, gold bricks? At any rate, the crates are far too heavy for you to move.
- **Command [opening or searching crates]:** The crates are all nailed shut.
- **Command [climbing on crates]:** You nimbly hop up on top of the crates; from there, it's only a short scramble to the roof of the market.

**Command [leaving Alley while mercenary dialogue is still going]:** 
Something -- an intuition? -- tells you it would be a good idea to stay out of sight for the moment. Maybe if you got some elevation, you could hear better.

### Mercenary Dialogue Sequence

**Event [first turn in the Alley, after the room description]:**

**Programming Note:** [The following messages start on the first turn and continue for the next five turns, one message. The messages can be heard from the Alley and from the Outer Market Roof. The text of each message is different depending whether the player is in the Alley or the Outer Market Roof.]

#### First message
- **Alley:** A group of people have gathered just outside the alley. You can't quite hear what they're saying from here, but there is a grim, ugly tone to them that speaks of dangerous doings.

#### Second message
- **Alley:** The voices continue. You make out the phrase, "...spread out..."
- **Outer Market Roof:** "...we know he skulks Grubber's most mornings, so spread out quick, cover all streets from the square," growls one of them, evidently the group's leader.

#### Third message
- **Alley:** The voices continue. You make out the phrase, "...knives covered..."
- **Outer Market Roof:** The leader spits on the dusty ground. "Keep your eyes open and don't take guff. But for the love of Brigid, keep your tempers and your knives covered unless you really need em. Ain't bein paid to toss the locals."

#### Fourth message
- **Alley:** The voices continue. You make out the phrase, "...stay out of sight..."
- **Outer Market Roof:** "And keep sharp!" the leader snaps. "Remember this is a kid we're lookin for. Kids move fast, stay out of sight, slip through crowds easy. I find out later he got away under your nose, I'll have it off!"

Suddenly, that bit of apple you swallowed a minute ago turns into a cold, hard chunk in your belly.

#### Fifth message
- **Alley:** The voices continue. You make out the phrase, "...got all that?"
- **Outer Market Roof:** "Now, everyone memorize the description." The leader pulls a dirty, folded bit of parchment from his belt and squints at it. "Shoulder-length brown hair," he reads, haltingly. "Green eyes. Slight of build. 'Ten, maybe twelve spans high." He holds his hand out flat, at what happens to be exactly your height. "Wears a gray cloak."

He refolds the parchment and jams it back into his belt. "You dims got all that?"

The others nod.

#### Sixth message
- **Alley:** Someone barks, "Okay, go!" You hear the jingle of mail and buckles as several heavy pairs of boots tromp past the alley entrance. You're not sure what just happened, but something tells you that it can't be good.

- **Outer Market Roof:** "Okay, go!" barks the leader, and the mercenaries set out in several directions, moving at a brisk walk. Two men position themselves at the gate to Lord's Road, leading out of town; the others enter the crowded market and start shoving their way through the suddenly flabbergasted crowds.

Your heart sinks. This is definitely not good.

## 5. Outer Market Roof

**Description:** 
The tiled roof of the storehouse is steep, but there's just enough purchase for you to scramble up to the top and get a look around. From here you have a good view of the market's northwest junction and the gate to Lord's Road heading north.

**Command [going any direction other than down]:** 
Not a good idea; the rooftops of the buildings surrounding the market are steep and slick, and the tiles have been known to come loose and fall off. It's precarious enough just staying here in one spot. If you're to make your escape, you'll have to make it down on the ground.

### NPC: Mercenary Group (as visible from Outer Market Roof, during opening dialogue)

**Initial Appearance:** 
A group of tough-looking mercenaries has gathered at the Northwest Junction. One of them is barking orders at the others in an angry voice.

**Description:** 
They're not Lord's Guards, that's for sure. They wear no insignia, for one thing. Their arms and armor are mismatched, ugly, and scarred -- not an unfit description of the men themselves, either. Also, while the Guard would be concerned with keeping the peace in Grubber's Market, these bravos look ready to clobber anyone who gets in their way, and maybe burn down a few stalls while they're at it.

So what are they doing here, you wonder? And come to think of it, where are the Lord's Guard, anyway?

**Command [talking to the Mercenary Group]:** 
Somehow, you think it might be unwise to attract their attention.

**Command [doing anything to the Mercenary Group]:** 
Not while they're down on the ground and you're up on this roof.
