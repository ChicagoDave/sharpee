# Chapter I - The Monkey and Exotic Gems

## 12. Exotic Gems Stall

**Description**: 
The shelves of this stall are lined with black velvet cloth, across which are spread dozens of jewels in exotic colors and cuts, all glittering in the dusty sunlight. Other stalls lie to the west and northeast.

### Object: Gems (collectively)
- **Description**: Some of them are loose stones; others are set in finely wrought rings and necklaces. Most of them were probably illegally smuggled from over the western mountains, which is why they're cheap enough to be affordable by anyone in Grubber's Market. Still, they're far, far out of your price range.

## NPC: Monkey

### Initial Event

**Event [after entering the Gem Stall]**: 
Suddenly you hear a commotion from the back of the stall: the crash of a display case hitting the ground; shouts and curses from the stall keeper; and a horrific, gibbering shriek.

"Come back here, you flea-bitten thief!" yells the stall keeper, and for a panicked moment you think he means *you*. Then you see something small and gray dart up to the roof of the stall... it's just a forest monkey, probably someone's pet running loose. And it's clutching one of the stall keeper's necklaces in its tiny black fist.

The monkey turns and screeches back at the stall keeper, dodges a clumsily thrown dirt clod, and scampers up the nearby support pole.

### Appearance and Description

**Initial appearance (up on the pole):** 
The monkey is here balances on the wire, just a few feet away.

**Description:** 
It has silvery fur and black mask-like markings on its startlingly human face. It seems to regard you with a mixture of curiosity and amusement, as though you were some strange little animal whose antics it found entertaining. [if it has the necklace] It grips the necklace like a cherished possession, tight against its tiny chest.

### Idle Behaviors

**Idle Behavior (1 in 5 chance each turn):**
- The monkey bounces up and down on its wire, screeching happily.
- The monkey turns the necklace over and over in its tiny hands, staring intently into the gem's blue depths.
- The monkey tosses the necklace high in the air, swings itself under the wire and back up again with its tail, and at the last second catches the necklace in its little black hands.
- The monkey hoots at you.
- The monkey sniffs at you and shrieks with amusement.

**Idle Behavior when the player is holding the banana (1 in 5 chance each turn):**
- The monkey sniffs at you excitedly, and emits a hopeful chirp.
- The monkey hops up and down on the wire, and makes a gesture with its tiny hands as though it were peeling a banana.
- The monkey stares hungrily at your banana.

### Interactions

**Command [taking the necklace from the monkey]:** [pick one at random]
- The monkey screeches at you and backs away.
- The monkey jumps back, chattering angrily and holding the necklace out of reach.
- The monkey scampers back, clutching the necklace to its chest.
- The monkey hops back a few feet on the wire and blows a raspberry at you, as though daring you to come after it.

### The Trade

**Command [trading the banana for the necklace/giving banana to the monkey]:** 
You hold the banana out and wiggle it enticingly. "Here, monkey. C'mon, little monkey," you whisper, trying to ignore how stupid it sounds.

The monkey creeps closer, eyes locked on the yellow fruit. It's only about a foot away from your out-stretched hand now. It's little face contorts into bizarre expressions as it wrestles with the conflicting desires to grab the tasty treat, hold onto the shiny trinket, and stay out of your reach, all at the same time.

Suddenly the monkey lunges. You make with your free hand. The monkey grabs the banana just as your fingers hooks around the necklace's chain. The monkey screams and jumps six feet straight up, lands on your head, and scampers off down the wire behind you. Your heart leaps into your throat as you lose your balance on top of the pole. You totter, pinwheel your arms... and stay on.

You're breathing hard, but you're safe. And you have the necklace.

Somewhere far below you, a stallkeeper is cursing and wiping smushed banana off his face.

### Object: Necklace
- **Description**: It's a beautiful gem, clear blue with a deep indigo star in its center, set in a silver-wrought starburst on a silver chain. You could easily trade it for any piece of merchandise in the market. Or you could... you know... wear it.
