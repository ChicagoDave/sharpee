# Chapter I - Market Stalls (Trading)

## 11. Hat Stall

**Description**: 
Hats of all styles and sizes hang from scores of wooden pegs, surrounding the stall itself in forest of varied headgear. More stalls lie to the north and southwest.

### Object: Hats
- **Description:** If you can wear it on your head, it's sold here. Big, flop-brimmed traveling hats; small, leather workman's caps; wide *sappans* of woven straw from the Kozar delta; fancy, feathered hats for courtly balls; and even a few ordinary bonnets.
- **Command [trade or buy hat]:** You already have a perfectly serviceable hat -- better save your money for something more useful.

## 13. Weapons Trader Stall

**Description**: 
The weaponsmith's wares hang from wooden racks along the sides of this stall, a grim picket fence of down-hanging blades. You can find less intimidating stalls to the east and northwest.

### Object: Weapons, Swords, Knives (collectively)
- **Description:** Swords and knives, mostly. Nothing fancy; just sharp, practical, and deadly.

### Trading Interactions

**Command [trade knife for coin, first time]:** 
The stallkeeper takes the weapon from you and turns it over in his large, scarred hands, frowning. He looks at you, then he looks over at one of the mercenaries swaggering around at the far end of the market, bullying the other market-goers and scaring away business. Then he smirks.

"Here you go," he says, reaching into his apron pocket and tossing you a coin. "Spend it wisely."

**Command [trade knife for coin, subsequent times]:** 
The weaponsmith raises his eyebrow as you hand him another knife. [if a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds]"Always in the market for more saleable merchandise," he says.[end if] He takes the blade and flips you another coin.

**Command [buy weapons]:** 
"I'm afraid most of my wares are out of your price range, boy," says the smith with a shrug. "But I do take trade."

### Object: Coin
- **Description:** It's a silver coin, thick and heavy. Stamped on one side is the Toresal coat of arms; on the other, a crescent moon. It's enough to buy something inexpensive, if you're not too picky about getting change.

## 14. Leather Shop

**Description**: 
You pause here for a few deep breaths -- you've always enjoyed the smell around the leather merchant's stall. More stalls lie to the north and southeast.

**Command [smell]:** 
The smell of leather reminds always makes you think of traveling in distant, dangerous lands. It's the smell of adventure.

### Object: Leather goods (collectively)
- **Description**: This merchant deals in riding equipment -- reins, harnesses, stirrups, and the like. A full riding saddle sits on proud display near the back. There are a few items of clothing for sale as well, mostly various styles of scabbards and belts.

### Object: Saddle
- **Description:** It's well out of your price range. Besides, horses make you nervous.

### Object: Scabbard
- **Description:** Some of the scabbards are very pretty, but they're not much use to you without a sword.

### Object: Belt
- **Description [looking at belts on display]:** Now, a good belt is always useful. The ones on display here aren't anything fancy, but they're sturdy and well-crafted.
- **Description [looking at individual belt, after you've bought it]:** A sturdy and supple strap of leather, three feet long.

## 15. Herb Stall

**Description**: 
The herb stall is usually a quieter place. Customers like to browse, poke their noses into the various jars and pouches, and judge the potency of a potential purchase at their leisure. You've never understood the fascination, yourself. More interesting stalls are to the south, and the market opens out a little to the north.

### Object: Herbs (collectively)
- **Description:** The herb stall is usually a quieter place. Customers like to browse, poke their noses into the various jars and pouches, and judge the potency of a potential purchase at their leisure. You've never understood the fascination, yourself.

## 16. Candle Maker Stall

**Description**: 
The heat and fumes from the candle maker's tallow pots make this stall an unpleasant place to loiter. Still, people need candles, and customers seem to be buying them as fast as the stall keeper can dip them. Other stalls are to the southeast and southwest.

### Object: Candles (collectively)
- **Description**: The candles hang in pairs from long wooden dowels, connected to each other by their common wick. Most of them are tallow, fast-burning and cheap, but near the back there are boxes of premade wax candles in different colors.

### Object: Tallow Pots
- **Description**: The candle merchant keeps a pair of small cauldrons at a constant boil, filled with bubbling, yellowing goop.

## 17. Rope Stall

**Description**: 
One thing you can say about the rope stall: you'll never spend a moment wondering what's for sale. Rope and lots of it, thick and thin, knotted or loose, in heaps and in coils, stacked on the floor or hanging from pegs. More stalls are to the northeast and southeast, and the market opens out a bit to the northwest.

### Object: Rope [on display]
- **Description:** Coarse braids of scratchy hemp, stiff and tough.
- **Command [purchase rope with coin]:** The rope merchant takes your coin and looks at it for a moment, considering its worth. Then he takes the end of one of his cheaper coils, measures out about ten feet, cuts it, and tosses it to you.

### Object: Rope [inventory object]
- **Description:** The rope is thick and stiffened with tar. The rough hemp scratches your hands when you try to grip it.

## 18. Pottery Stall

**Description**: 
The wares at the pottery stall are spread out on the ground or set on low benches, forcing browsers and passers-by to step carefully around them. There are more stalls to the northwest and southwest, or you can head out to the market's edge to the east.

### Object: Pottery (collectively)
- **Description:** From tall, narrow, precariously balanced urns to round, gourd-like jars to shallow bowls, each is uniquely shaped, yet they all share a common, graceful curve. Most of them are made of fired clay from the Westlands, decorated with colorful glazes.
