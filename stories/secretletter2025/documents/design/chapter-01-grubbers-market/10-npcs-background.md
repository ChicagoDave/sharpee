# Chapter I - NPCs and Background Characters

## 21. NPC: Stallkeeper

**Description:** 
The stallkeeper looks nervous and irritable. Armed thugs stomping around the Grubber's Market is not good for business.

### Interactions

**Command [talking to the stallkeeper]:** [random response]
- The stallkeeper waves you off. "Take it somewhere else, kid."
- The stallkeeper seems too distracted to talk to you.
- The stallkeeper grunts noncommitally.

**Command [buying something from the stallkeeper]:** 
The stallkeeper barely glances at the coin before dropping it into his purse. "Sure, sure," he mutters, handing you [whatever]. "Here you go. Now beat it, all right?"

**Command [taking something from a stall without paying for it]:** 
Better not. Not only do the mercenaries have everyone on edge, but a good third of the normal shopping crowd have been scared off, which makes it that much easier for the stallkeeper to keep an eye on you. And if you get caught, the uproar will bring the mercenaries right to you.

**Command [doing anything to a stallkeeper's wares other than examining or smelling it]:** 
"Hey!" the stallkeeper glares at you. "Keep your sticky fingers away from the goods."

## 27. NPC: Shoppers/Marketgoers/Townsfolk 
(scenery, present in all Grubber's Market locations)

**Description:** 
The crowd here includes all sorts: country folk; poorer townsfolk; middle-class merchants looking for a bargain; servants of the upper class; even a few tourists and sea merchants come upriver from the coast. [if the Mercenary is in the location]Most of them keep their heads down and give the mercenary a wide berth.[end if] All of them are far too busy to pay attention to you.

### Interactions

**Command [talking to the shoppers, first time]:** 
Some of the marketfolk glance at you; a few put their hands protectively around their moneypurses. But no one seems interested in having a conversation with a common street urchin.

**Command [talking to the shoppers, subsequent tries]:** 
It's no use; these people just want to get on with their business and be left alone.

**Command [doing anything else to the shoppers]:** (pick at random)
- "Here, you! Scamper off, why don't you?"
- The shopper roughly shoulders you aside.
- The shopper waves you off, irritated.
- "Take it somewhere else, kid, fore I call the guard."
