# Chapter I - Teisha and the Silk Stall

## 19. Outside Silk Stall

**Description**: 
Teisha has done well enough for herself that her "stall" is actually a full-on tent. You can enter the tent to the north, or continue on to other stalls to the northeast or northwest.

## 20. Inside Silk Stall

**Description**: 
The fabric walls lend a bit of privacy and quiet from the crowds outside (in addition to keeping dust off the merchandise). Beautiful silk garments hang from racks on either side. The main market lies to the south. A narrow gap in the back leads behind the tent.

### Object: Garments (collectively)
- **Description:** Gowns, robes, capes, cloaks, and shawls -- their hems rippling with the slightest movement of air, shimmering with that soft, liquid glow that only silk has. You sigh. Dressing up like a boy is definitely *fun*, but looking at Teisha's wares always makes you yearn for something a little bit more... elegant.

## NPC: Teisha

### Basic Information

**Initial Appearance**: 
Teisha sits on a stool in back, smiling distractedly.

**Description:** 
Teisha is a short, busty woman with a smile as warm as her tumbling red curls. She likes you, and she knows that you'd never nick from her stall, so she lets you hang around the stall and look through the merchandise. She also knows your big secret (guessed it the very first time she caught you loitering at the tent flap), which is a little bit scary and a little bit of a relief -- it's nice to be able to let your guard down and talk to someone outside the Maiden's House.

### Idle Actions (Randomized)
- Teisha hums quietly to herself.
- Teisha smiles at you warmly.
- Teisha brushes a loose thread from the sleeve of one of her gowns.
- Teisha toys with her measuring cord, spinning it idly.

### Dialogue

**Command [entering the tent for the first time]:** 
"Hello, Jack," says Teisha. "Change your mind about that cloak?" Then she gets a look at your face and frowns. "Something the matter, sweetie? You look spooked."

**Command [entering tent subsequent times]:** 
Teisha looks up. "Hi Jack. Hanging in there?"

**Command [talk to Teisha about Mercenaries for first time]:** 
"Mercenaries searching the market?" Teisha peeks out through the front flap. "Brigid help us," she mutters, glancing back at you. Although you know she cares about you, you also know that Teisha is a smart, practical woman, and first and foremost she is worried about losing her customers. "All right," she sighs, letting the flap fall closed. "You don't need to tell me if they're after you. I don't want to know. There's no room for you to hide in here, but if you want to you can slip out that way---" she points to the narrow gap in the back wall of the tent--- "and I'll pretend I never saw you."

**Command [talk to Teisha about mercenaries -- subsequent]:** 
She makes a face. "I don't like it, Jack, but there's nothing I can do. Just try to stay out of their way."

**Command [talk to Teisha about the monkey]:** 
Teisha rolls her eyes. "That pesky thing came in on with the fruit vendor's wagon yesterday and just made itself at home. Now it's all over the place, bothering everybody. Fortunately, it likes shiny things more than it likes women's clothes. Oh, and bananas. The little rodent loves bananas. Constantly drops the peels on the roof of my tent, too."

**Command [talk to Teisha about the necklace]:** 
"That monkey got one of Hathid's necklaces?" Teisha laughs. "Ha! Serves the old huckster right. You should try giving it a banana, see if it'll trade."

**Command [talk to Teisha about the cloak]:** 
"I can't just give you one, sweetie," Teisha says, sadly. "These silks are expensive, and I have to pay my suppliers and make a living for myself. If you have coin, or something worth trading, maybe I can cut you a deal. Otherwise..."

### Trading for the Cloak

**Command [trade something other than necklace for cloak]:** 
Teisha shakes her head and hands the [whatever] back to you. "This just won't do," she says, not unkindly.

**Command [trade necklace for cloak]:** 
Teisha's eyebrow shoots up when you show her the necklace, but she manages to hide her excitement with the coolness of a professional haggler. "Not top quality," she mutters, "but very nice..." She gives you a look. "Now, tell me the truth, Jack, you didn't just steal this from somewhere, did you?"

You shake your head proudly. It's not *exactly* a lie.

"All right." The necklace disappears into one of Teisha's pockets. "Let's see..." she starts searching through the clothes on the racks, looking for something in your size. "This should fit. I think it suits you, too." She holds out a girl's cloak, simple but elegant. "What do you think?"

It's beautiful. Eagerly you nod your agreement.

Teisha smiles. "Then it's yours."

### After Trading

**Command [putting on the cloak in Teisha's presence -- first time]:** 
Teisha leans over and adjusts the fit, plucking at the fabric where it hangs from your shoulders. "I was right," she says. "It brings out your eyes. You look... almost *royal*."

**Command [north -- first time]:** 
Teisha holds the back flap back as you duck through. "Be careful now..." she says, "...*Jacqueline*."

**Command [north -- subsequent]:** 
"Careful out there," calls Teisha as you duck through the back again.

### Object: Silk Cloak
- **Description**: It comes down to your ankles, a simple drape of soft, dusky green with silver trim. [if worn]You're wearing it in the feminine style, forward over both shoulders and clasped under your chin.

## 24. Behind the Silk Tent

**Description**: 
This is an empty space formed by the backs of three stalls and Teisha's tent, meeting at the corners to form a cramped little square. It's barely big enough to stretch your arms out in. Right in the middle is the base of the huge central support post, which rises up a good twenty feet from here. You can duck back into Teisha's tent to the south.

### Object: Center Post
- **Description**: It's huge, almost too big to put your arms around. Way up at the top, you can see wires stretching out in each of the cardinal directions.
- **Command [climb post, up]:** You're totally hidden back here, so there's no one to stop you from climbing. By the time you're high enough for people to see you, you're also high enough that no one will notice anyway; no one ever bothers to look up in the Grubber's Market. After a minute or so of grunting and sweating, you reach the top.
