## Chapter Summary
The story begins with Jack (Jacqueline) being hunted by mercenaries in Grubber's Market. The player must use stealth, disguise, and acrobatics to escape the market and reach Commerce Street.

## Rundown

- You have no money. You are wearing a wool cloak. You have an apple.
- You may steal a knife from a mercenary.
- You may trade the knife for nearly anything in the market including herbs, fruit, candles, rope, pottery, silk, belt, boots, coin, small gem, or a hat. You will always be able to steal another knife, but never hold more than one at a time.
- The monkey wants a banana.
- The monkey has a necklace and will trade for a banana.
- The monkey runs across the postal wires all the time. If you're at the Exotic Gems stall, he will come down to its roof and taunt you with the necklace.
- Teisha, in the silk stall, will give you a silk cloak for the necklace.
- You can get a hat by trading your cloak.
- You can get a belt by trading a hat.
- You can get fruit with coin.
- You can never go east to the Eastern Edge or you will be caught and have to escape back to the west.
- You can go up the center post and slide down to any of the outer posts.
- When you slide down, the guards will see you. You should not be wearing the cloak yet.
- When you go down from the n, w, or s post, you should wear the cloak and undo your hair so that you look like a girl.
- Now you can leave the market before the men recognize you.

## Design Notes

- Should the monkey be able to block you from sliding down? If so, how should we get rid of the monkey? This _has_ to be a funny response. I can just feel it.

- If you simply turn into a girl and start walking directly out of the market, the mercenaries at the eastern edge are so loose that they're pretty much accosting everyone and will catch you. In order to get past them, they must be on edge from seeing you traverse the wire from the center post.

## Key Mechanics

1. **Disguise System**: Player can switch between boy (Jack) and girl (Jacqueline) appearance
2. **Trading System**: Complex bartering chain to obtain necessary items
3. **Stealth/Chase**: Avoiding mercenaries while navigating the market
4. **Acrobatics**: Using the market's structure (posts and wires) for escape
