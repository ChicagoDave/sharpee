# Chapter I - Opening Scene

## 1. Introduction

**Event [before play begins]:** 
Mid-morning always sees the Grubber's Market at its most crowded. Servants from the aristocratic districts and villagers from outside Toresal crush themselves into the maze of stalls and stretched canvas, hoping to beat the noontime heat and get the farmers' produce while it's still fresh. The press of bodies, the din of haggling and bargains struck -- it all makes getting around unnoticed easier, although not necessarily more pleasant. No fewer than half a dozen stall-gazing bumpkins have trod on your feet already this morning. You've kept your mouth shut, though. People remember an urchin who gives lip.

"See anything you like?" asks the woman at the silk stall, with a teasing smile. You smile back. You couldn't afford the cheapest of her cloaks if you nicked ten purses in a morning, as Teisha well knows.

"Oh, these are *much* too plain," you scoff, even as you gaze wistfully at the bright colors, the beautiful embroidery. Time for a bit of breakfast, you decide, and anyway if you linger too long, people will wonder what a boy is doing shopping for women's cloaks. "Perhaps I'll come back this afternoon, when you've put out your better wares."

Teisha laughs. "Don't be a stranger, Jack."

You make your way through the market, nicking an apple from the fruit stall while its owner haggles with some fat outlander over a bushel of kello fruit, until you reach a quiet alley where you can catch a breath from the crowds and enjoy your breakfast in peace. All in all, just another ordinary day at Grubber's Market.

But the first bite is barely in your mouth before you hear rough voices at the alley's entrance, and in a moment your life is turned upside-down.

## 2. The Player Character

**Description:** 
Most people know you as "Jack," a fourteen-year-old street urchin of uncertain means. You are slight of build for a boy your age, though your baggy clothes hide much of your physique. Your shoulder-length hair is ragged, a victim of many self-inflicted trimmings. Though usually in need of a good scrubbing, you are an attractive youth, with a softness to your face that makes you seem younger than your years.

Fortunately, it also leads people to underestimate your wiles and resourcefulness, which has caused more than one stall keeper to call you by your second most common sobriquet, "That Damn Thief!"

Only a few people know you by your real name, and you are pleased to keep it that way.

## 3. Starting Inventory

### Object: Apple
- **Description:** Round, taut, green at the bottom shading up to red near the stem.

### Object: Cloak (wool, masculine)
- **Description:** Your cloak is made of un-dyed wool, stained and patched in several places. You wear it in the masculine style, buckled to the side and thrown back over your right shoulder.

### Object: Satchel (cloth)
- **Description:** Your trusty cloth satchel: big enough to hold the things you nick, small enough to not hamper your getaway.

### Object: Hat
- **Description:** A woolen cap, patchy and stained like the rest of you. Your hair is a bit longer than the fashion for boys your age, so you usually keep it stuffed up into your hat.
