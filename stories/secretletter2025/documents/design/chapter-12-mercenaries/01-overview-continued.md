# Chapter XII â€“ Mercenaries (continued)

### 6. The Old Woman (continued)

**The Crone Speaks:**
"Well, well. The lost princess seeks her castle. But you don't look much like a princess, do you, boy-girl?"

**Your Response:**
"I'm not a princess. I'm the Duke's daughter, and I need to reach the Keep."

**The Crone's Laugh:**
"Duke's daughter, princess, what's the difference? You all think you're entitled to things. But tell me, girl - what makes you different from the Baron you seek to overthrow?"

### 7. The Test

**The Crone's Questions:**
"Would you kill for your inheritance?"
- Your answer: "I'd rather not kill at all."

"Would you let others die for it?"
- Your answer: "Bobby already did. I can't let his sacrifice be meaningless."

"What will you do with power if you get it?"
- Your answer: "Try to be like my father. Just. Kind. Better than those who came before."

**The Crone's Assessment:**
"Hmm. Not the worst answers I've heard. You have your mother's heart, at least. She came to me once, seeking herbs for healing. Good woman."

### 8. The Potion

**Event [the offering]:**
The crone produces a small vial from her robes. The liquid inside shimmers with an unnatural light.

**The Crone's Explanation:**
"You still look too much like the boy you've pretended to be. This will complete what nature started. But magic always has a price."

**Pieter's Warning:**
"My lady, don't. We don't know what it might do."

**Fiona's Recognition:**
"Wait... I know you. You're the Wise Woman of the Woods. Catherine spoke of you. You helped her conceive when the physicians said it was impossible."

**The Crone Nods:**
"I did. And now I help her daughter. The wheel turns, child. Drink, if you dare."

### 9. The Transformation

**Event [drinking the potion]:**
It tastes of flowers and earth and something wild. Warmth spreads through your body, then concentrates in your scalp.

**The Change:**
Your hair, roughly cut for years, suddenly grows. It spills down your shoulders in waves, reaching nearly to your waist. The color deepens, becomes lustrous.

**Other Effects:**
- Your features soften slightly
- Your posture naturally straightens
- Your voice, when you speak, has found its true tone
- You look, finally, fully like your mother's daughter

**The Crone's Satisfaction:**
"There. Now you look like what you are. Remember, girl - magic given freely must be repaid freely. Someday, I'll call on you."

### 10. The Secret Door

**Event [crone disappears]:**
Between one blink and the next, she's gone. Only the scent of herbs lingers.

**Finding the Entrance:**
With your transformation complete, you lead the others to the hidden door. It's exactly where Bobby showed you, covered in ivy.

**The Key Still Works:**
The lock protests but turns. The door opens into darkness.

### 11. Through the Secret Passage

**Description:** The passage is narrow and dusty. Clearly unused since Bobby brought you here. Your ball gown catches on rough stones, but you press on.

**Sounds from Above:**
- Orchestra music, muffled but clear
- Hundreds of voices in conversation
- Laughter, some forced, some genuine
- The ball is in full swing

### 12. Emergence into the Keep

**Description:** You emerge in a storage room filled with musical instruments. Through the door, you can hear servants rushing past.

**Quick Adjustments:**
- Fiona helps brush dust from your gown
- You pin up your new length of hair
- Pieter checks his uniform is straight
- Rudolph tries to look less conspicuous (fails)

### 13. Into the Ball

**The Musician's Gallery Plan:**
Pieter leads you up narrow stairs to the gallery overlooking the ballroom. From here, you can see everything without being seen.

**The Scene Below:**
The ballroom is magnificent. Hundreds of candles, mirrors reflecting light infinitely. Nobles in jeweled clothing dance and mingle. At the far end, a throne sits empty - waiting for the Queen.

**Spotting the Baron:**
He's near the throne, resplendent in black and gold. Beside him stands a woman in an elaborate gown - Princess Elizaveta. She looks pale, resigned.

**The Clock:**
A great clock shows half past nine. Thirty minutes until the Queen arrives. Thirty minutes to position yourself.

### 14. Observing the Enemy

**Baron's Security:**
- His personal guard, Kristof, shadows him constantly
- Mercenaries at every door
- Even servants are being watched
- He's taking no chances

**The Princess:**
She seems disconnected from the festivities. Her eyes scan the crowd as if looking for something... or someone. When the Baron touches her arm, she flinches.

**Potential Allies:**
You spot some familiar faces in the crowd:
- Mrs. Sandler, there as a merchant guest
- Some of your father's old associates
- Even Olgan Minor, looking uncomfortable in formal wear

### 15. The Plan Adjusts

**Pieter's Observation:**
"The Queen will enter from the main doors. The Baron will be beside her immediately. We need to intercept her before he can control the situation."

**Your Decision:**
"When she enters, I'll come down the main stairs. Publicly. Let everyone see me. Make it impossible for him to act without revealing himself."

**Fiona's Fear:**
"He might kill you on the spot."

**Your Resolve:**
"Not in front of the Queen. Not without showing his true nature. He's spent years building his reputation. He won't throw it away."

### 16. Final Moments

**Event [bells beginning to chime]:**
The great clock begins to strike ten. Below, the crowd turns toward the main doors. Fanfare sounds.

**Pieter's Last Advice:**
"Remember, you're not just presenting evidence. You're presenting yourself. Show them the ruler you could be."

**Your Preparation:**
- Touch your mother's locket for courage
- Feel the stiletto's weight for confidence  
- Straighten your father's signet ring
- Take a deep breath

**The Announcement:**
"Her Majesty, Queen Mariana of Jais Del Brin!"

The doors open. The Queen enters, elderly but regal.

And you step out onto the main staircase, into the light, into your destiny.

Every head turns. Gasps ripple through the crowd. The Baron's face goes white, then red with rage.

But you descend with grace, your new hair flowing, your mother's jewels catching the light, your father's bearing in every step.

The game's final move begins.
