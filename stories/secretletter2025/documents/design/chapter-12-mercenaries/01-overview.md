# Chapter XII - Mercenaries

## Map
[Map placeholder - see original document]

## Rundown
Based on the synopsis: "Jack and Pieter cannot enter Lord's Keep directly as the mercenaries are all standing guard. Jack shows Pieter the secret entrance. On their way through the woods, an odd old woman approaches them. She cryptically offers Jack a potion. The potion makes Jack's hair grow out. They enter the Keep and filter into the ball room, uninvited. The Queen has not arrived yet."

## Notes
- The mercenaries are blocking the main entrance
- Jack knows a secret way through the woods
- Encounter with mysterious woman (possibly magical)
- The potion causes Jack's hair to grow to a more feminine length
- They successfully infiltrate the ball before the Queen arrives
