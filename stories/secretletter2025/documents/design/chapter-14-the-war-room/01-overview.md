## Design

### 1. The Letter Burns

**Event [Baron drops the letter into flames]:**
You watch in horror as your father's letter - your proof, your birthright - curls and blackens in the fire. The wax seal melts, your father's signature disappears into ash.

**The Baron's Satisfaction:**
"There. Now you're nothing again. Just another orphan who will disappear."

**Your Defiance:**
"That was a copy. Others know the truth."

**His Confidence:**
"Let them try to prove it. I have the Queen's ear, the Princess's hand, and an army at my command. Who will believe a dead street thief?"

### 2. The Baron Draws His Sword

**Description:** He pulls his blade from its sheath with practiced ease. The steel gleams in the firelight. This is not ceremonial - it's a weapon that has seen blood.

**The Baron's Approach:**
"I had planned something more elaborate. A public disgrace, a tragic suicide. But this has a certain poetry. You'll die in the same room where your father sealed your fate by acknowledging you."

**Your Options:**
- The stiletto in your bodice (but can you reach it in time?)
- Pieter on the floor (too far away)
- The mercenaries watching (enjoying the show)
- No escape

### 3. The Commotion Outside

**Event [Sudden sounds]:**
Shouting from beyond the door. The clash of steel. A mercenary's scream cut short.

**The Guards' Confusion:**
The mercenaries in the room exchange worried glances. One moves toward the door.

**The Baron's Anger:**
"What now? Can't you fools do anything right?"

**Escalating Sounds:**
The fighting outside intensifies. You hear voices shouting, "For Toresal! For the true heir!"

### 4. The Door Explodes Inward

**Event [Dramatic entrance]:**
The heavy oak door splinters off its hinges. Through the wreckage steps a figure you never thought to see again.

Bobby. Alive. Bloodied but standing. Sword in hand.

**Your Shock:**
"Bobby? But... you're dead. I heard the bells. They said they hanged you!"

**Bobby's Grin:**
"Takes more than a rope to kill a royal spy, Jack. Though it was a close thing."

### 5. The Revelation

**Bobby's Quick Explanation:**
"Old Tom and his crew. They cut me down after the soldiers left. Been recovering in the sewers. Heard about tonight. Couldn't let you face him alone."

**The Baron's Rage:**
"Impossible! I watched you hang myself!"

**Bobby's Defiance:**
"You watched what you wanted to see. Just like you missed the servants' uprising happening right under your nose. Half your mercenaries are fighting for their lives right now."

### 6. The Challenge

**Bobby Formal Declaration:**
"Baron Fossville, I challenge you in the name of Lady Jacqueline Toresal, rightful Duchess of these lands. Face me, murderer."

**The Baron's Contempt:**
"A gutter spy challenges me? Very well. I'll kill you properly this time."

**The Duel Begins:**
They circle each other. Bobby is younger, faster, but still weak from his ordeal. The Baron is experienced, deadly, and furious.

### 7. Jack Acts

**Event [While they fight]:**
You drop to your knees beside Pieter, pulling out your stiletto. The blade slices through his bonds.

**Pieter's Recovery:**
"My lady... give me the blade. The mercenaries..."

**Your Decision:**
You hand him the stiletto and help him stand. He immediately moves to guard your back as two mercenaries advance.

### 8. The Duel Intensifies

**The Fight:**
- Bobby fights with desperate energy
- The Baron fights with cold precision
- Steel rings against steel
- They exchange wounds - both bleeding

**Bobby's Determination:**
"Three years I've protected her! Three years of watching you poison everything you touch!"

**The Baron's Cruelty:**
"And you failed! Just like her father failed! Just like you'll fail now!"

### 9. The Tide Turns

**Event [The Baron gains advantage]:**
A brutal feint, and the Baron's sword finds Bobby's shoulder. Bobby staggers, his guard dropping.

**The Baron's Killing Stroke:**
He raises his sword for the final blow...

**Your Intervention:**
Without thinking, you grab a heavy candlestick and hurl it. It strikes the Baron's sword arm, spoiling his aim. His blade goes wide.

### 10. Bobby's Opportunity

**Event [Bobby recovers]:**
In that moment of distraction, Bobby lunges. His sword pierces the Baron's side, sliding between ribs.

**The Baron's Shock:**
He looks down at the spreading red stain on his doublet. "No... this isn't... I am Baron Fossville!"

**Bobby's Response:**
"You're a murderer and a traitor. And now you're finished."

### 11. The Baron's Retreat

**Event [The Baron staggers back]:**
Clutching his wound, the Baron backs toward the door. The mercenaries, seeing their master wounded and hearing the fighting outside, begin to waver.

**The Baron's Last Command:**
"Kill them all! I'll double your pay! Triple it!"

**Mercenary Doubt:**
But they can hear their comrades dying in the corridors. One throws down his sword. "Not for any amount of gold."

### 12. The Escape

**Event [The Baron flees]:**
Realizing he's lost control, the Baron stumbles out of the room. Blood drops mark his path.

**The Mercenaries Follow:**
Most run after their employer. Only one remains, and Pieter efficiently puts your stiletto through his throat.

**Bobby Collapses:**
"Jack... did we win?"

### 13. Checking on Bobby

**Event [You kneel beside Bobby]:**
His wounds are serious but not immediately fatal. The shoulder bleeds freely.

**Your Torn Dress:**
You tear strips from your expensive gown to bind his wounds. The emerald silk turns crimson.

**Bobby's Weak Smile:**
"Always saving me, aren't you? Even when you're the one needs saving."

### 14. Pieter's Report

**Pieter at the Door:**
"The corridors are clearing. The servants and loyal guards have risen. Old Tom's people came up through the cellars. The Baron's men are in retreat."

**Your Questions:**
"The Queen? The ball?"

**Pieter's Answer:**
"Chaos, my lady. But controlled chaos. Our people are keeping the guests safe. The Queen is protected. But the Baron..."

### 15. The Decision

**Your Choice:**
- Chase the Baron while he's wounded?
- Get Bobby to safety?
- Return to the Queen to explain?
- Secure the Keep?

**Bobby Insists:**
"Go to the Queen. Now. While the Baron's fled. Tell her everything. I'll live."

**Pieter Agrees:**
"He's right. This is your moment. Claim your birthright before he can regroup."

### 16. Preparing to Return

**Event [Standing to leave]:**
You're a sight - hair disheveled, gown torn and bloodied, face streaked with tears and determination. But you're alive. And you have witnesses.

**Final Exchange with Bobby:**
"Bobby... why didn't you tell me you were alive?"

"Had to stay dead. Had to let the Baron think he'd won. Only way to get him to move against you openly. I'm sorry, Jack."

"My name is Jacqueline."

"I know. Always knew. Now go be the Duchess we need."

**The Door Opens:**
But before you can leave, a new figure enters. Someone unexpected.
