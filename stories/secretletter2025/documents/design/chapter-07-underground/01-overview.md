# Chapter VII â€“ Underground

## Map

[Map placeholder - see original document]

## Rundown

- Jack navigates the sewer system beneath the city
- She must avoid dangers and find her way to the cemetery exit
- This chapter serves as a transition and builds tension before the Black Gate infiltration

## Notes

The underground represents both literal and metaphorical aspects - Jack is now operating outside the law, in the shadows, becoming part of the city's hidden world.

## Design

### 1. Sewer Entrance

**Description:** The ladder down seems to descend forever. The smell hits you first - centuries of waste and decay. But underneath it, there's something else. The smell of secrets. Of hidden things.

**Event [entering sewers]:**
Your feet splash into shallow water. In the darkness, you can barely make out the symbols Tom showed you, carved into the ancient stones.

### 2. The Main Tunnel

**Description:** The main sewer tunnel is larger than you expected - tall enough to stand upright, wide enough for three people to walk abreast. Channels of murky water run along both sides, while a raised walkway provides relatively dry footing down the center.

**Object: Carved Symbols**
- **Description:** The thieves' marks glow faintly in what little light filters down from above. An arrow pointing left, a circle with a dot meaning "safe," a crossed X meaning "danger."

### 3. Navigational Challenges

**The Intersection:**
- **Description:** The tunnel splits into four directions. Water drips steadily from above, and you can hear distant sounds - voices? footsteps? - echoing from multiple directions.
- **Choice:** Follow the symbols, follow the sounds, or trust your instinct about direction.

**The Collapsed Section:**
- **Description:** Part of the tunnel has caved in, leaving only a narrow gap near the ceiling.
- **Challenge:** Squeeze through carefully or find an alternate route.

### 4. Dangers in the Dark

**Event [hearing others in tunnels]:**
You're not alone down here. Footsteps echo behind you - heavy, booted feet. Guards? Or something worse?

**The Flooded Chamber:**
- **Description:** The tunnel opens into a larger chamber, flooded waist-deep with foul water. Something moves in the water - rats? Or something larger?
- **Command [wade through]:** The water is cold and thick with waste. You try not to think about what you're walking through. Something brushes against your leg, and you bite back a scream.

### 5. The Thieves' Cache

**Description:** Following Tom's symbols, you find one of the safe rooms he mentioned. It's dry and relatively clean, with supplies stored in waterproof containers.

**Found Items:**
- A hooded cloak (to replace your torn clothes)
- A small lamp with a few hours of oil
- Dried food and clean water
- A crude map of the sewer system

**The Map:** The map shows major landmarks above ground and their corresponding sewer locations. Black Gate Estate is marked with a skull - clearly even the thieves fear to go there.

### 6. Memories in the Dark

**Event [resting briefly]:**
In the quiet darkness, Bobby's words echo in your mind. "Tell them I tried." You think of all the times he watched over you, and you never knew. Was he a friend or just doing his duty? Does it matter now?

You think of your mother, dying to give you life. Your father, poisoned for trying to protect you. The maidens, living a lie for fourteen years just to keep you safe.

All these people who sacrificed for you. And now Bobby will hang at dawn because of you.

The weight of it all threatens to crush you. But then you remember Angeline's words: "We protect our own."

You are not alone. You have never been alone.

### 7. The Cemetery Approach

**Description:** The symbols lead you steadily upward. The tunnels grow older here, the stones covered with strange moss that glows faintly green. These passages predate the city above by centuries.

**Ancient Writings:**
- **Description:** Carved into the walls are inscriptions in an old language. You recognize a few words from Fiona's history lessons - something about "the sacred dead" and "eternal watch."

### 8. Guardian of the Passage

**Event [nearing the exit]:**
A figure steps out of the shadows - ancient, bent, wrapped in rags. For a moment you think it's a corpse risen from the cemetery above.

**The Sewer Hermit:**
- **Description:** Mad eyes gleam in a face so dirty you can't tell age or gender. But the voice, when it comes, is surprisingly clear.
- **Dialogue:** "Another one seeking the Black Gate? They all come through here, eventually. The desperate ones. The foolish ones. The dead ones."
- **Question:** "Tell me, girl-dressed-as-boy, what makes you different from the others who never returned?"

**Command [answer honestly about saving Bobby/seeking truth]:**
The hermit cackles. "Truth? In the house of lies? You'll find only death there. But..." They peer at you closely. "You have your mother's eyes. She came through here once too, seeking healing herbs in the Baron's garden. Back when it was your father's garden."

"Very well. I'll show you the way. But remember - the dead keep their own counsel. Don't disturb them more than necessary."

### 9. The Cemetery Exit

**Description:** The hermit leads you up a narrow spiral stair, carved directly into the rock. At the top, they push open a heavy stone door.

**Event [emerging]:**
Cool night air washes over you - a blessed relief after the sewers. You emerge inside a mausoleum, moonlight streaming through a broken roof. Outside, rows of headstones march into darkness, and beyond them, the high walls of Black Gate Estate.

**The Hermit's Warning:**
"The garden entrance is through the Fossville family crypt. Ironic, no? The Baron's own ancestors guard the way to his secrets."

"Follow the path of black stones. Don't step on the graves - the dead get angry. And girl... whatever you find in there, remember: some secrets are better left buried."

### 10. Among the Dead

**Description:** The cemetery at night is a maze of shadows and stone. Ancient trees twist overhead, their branches catching at your cloak. The black stone path the hermit mentioned is barely visible, winding between elaborate tombs and simple markers alike.

**Event [approaching Black Gate Estate]:**
The Fossville crypt looms before you - a massive stone edifice decorated with carved skulls and crossed swords. The family motto is etched above the door: "Victory Through Strength."

Behind it, the walls of Black Gate Estate rise like cliffs. Somewhere in that garden is the mermaid statue. Somewhere beyond that is the truth about your father's death.

And somewhere in the city, a clock tower chimes. Three hours until dawn. Three hours to find what you need and save Bobby.

If you can.
