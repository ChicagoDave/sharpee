## Minor Non-Playing Characters

### Teisha
Teisha is a girl in Grubber's market that is somewhat of a friend. She teases about the Maiden House and is somewhat aloof, but she is never mean to you. Although there is no blood relationship, the two of you look somewhat alike, if not a perfect match.

### Angeline, Clara, Fiona, Theresa, Shannon (Maiden House)
Angeline, Clara, Fiona, Theresa, and Shannon are the women in the Maiden House. They are all widows that look out for each other. They do various odd jobs for town folk and farmers who pay them in food and bare necessities. They know many things about the town and surrounding area, although they will very rarely offer details without some prior knowledge.

These women are the help system. They will offer information on how to solve problems within the game as you learn about them. So when you find a door you can't unlock (unlikely), they will know how to help you.

All of the women will occasionally be caught gossiping about town drama.
