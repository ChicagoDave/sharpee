## Design

### 1. Return to Commerce Street

**Description:** Commerce Street looks different when you arrive in your father's carriage. Shopkeepers who once shooed you away now bow and scrape. It's the same street, but you're not the same person.

**Event [disembarking]:**
Heads turn as you step down from the carriage. Whispers follow in your wake. "Is that... could it be... the Duke's daughter?"

### 2. The Moneylender - Chorus Brothers

**Description:** The blue-painted storefront of the Chorus Brothers seems less intimidating now. You sweep inside, Fiona at your side, documents in hand.

**The Brothers' Reaction:**
The two brothers - one tall and thin, one short and round - nearly fall over themselves when you present the inheritance papers.

**Tall Brother:**
"Lady Toresal! We... we always hoped this day would come. Your father's accounts have been waiting."

**Round Brother:**
"Compound interest for three years... substantial holdings... diverse investments... my lady, you are quite wealthy."

**Financial Revelations:**
- Multiple accounts totaling a fortune
- Investment returns have tripled the original sum
- Property revenues have been collecting
- You have enough to buy allies, raise troops, or simply disappear

**Immediate Needs:**
You withdraw enough for immediate expenses and arrange for lines of credit at various merchants.

### 3. The Clothier's Shop

**Description:** The clothier nearly faints when you enter. His hands shake as he shows you his finest wares.

**The Perfect Accessories:**
- Evening gloves of finest silk
- A cloak of midnight blue velvet
- Dancing slippers that fit perfectly
- A fan for court protocols
- A small beaded purse

**The Clothier's Gossip:**
"The whole city's talking about the ball, my lady. They say the Baron's spared no expense. Orchestra from the capital, food from across the kingdom, and security... well, mercenaries at every door."

### 4. Sandler's Jewelry Shop

**Description:** Mrs. Sandler beams as you enter, but her expression quickly turns serious.

**Event [meeting Pieter]:**
A young man in guard's attire stands near the counter. Tall, broad-shouldered, with intelligent eyes that miss nothing. This must be Pieter.

**Pieter's Introduction:**
"Lady Toresal," he says, bowing formally. "I served your father. Bobby was my friend. I've been waiting for you."

**Mrs. Sandler explains:**
"Pieter's maintained his position in the city guard while secretly working for your father's allies. He knows every guard rotation, every secret passage in the Keep."

### 5. Pieter's Intelligence

**Critical Information:**
"The Baron's tripled security for the ball. Mercenaries at every entrance, guards on every terrace. He's expecting trouble."

"But there's something else. The Princess... she's been trying to contact the underground. I think she's as unwilling as everyone suspects."

"The Queen will make her entrance at the tenth bell. The betrothal announcement is scheduled immediately after. That's your window."

### 6. Completing the Jewelry

**Mrs. Sandler's Gifts:**
- Matching bracelet for your mother's necklace
- Hair pins that are actually lockpicks
- A ring with a hidden compartment (for poison, she hints)

**Pieter's Assessment:**
"You look every inch the lady, but Bobby told me about your other skills. You'll need both tonight."

### 7. The Armory

**Description:** Olgan Minor's shop seems an odd destination for a lady, but Pieter insists.

**Event [choosing a weapon]:**
Pieter guides you to a specific blade - a stiletto, thin as a whisper, sharp as betrayal.

**Pieter's Advice:**
"Your corset has a reinforced channel here," he shows you discretely. "The blade will lie flat, invisible. But if you need it..."

**Olgan's Reaction:**
The stern armorer looks at you long and hard. "Your father was a good man," he says finally. "The Baron's bought many swords from me lately. Shame if one were used against him." He refuses payment.

### 8. Strategic Discussion

**At a Private Table in a Tea Shop:**

**Pieter's Plan:**
"I can get you in through the servant's entrance. My uniform, your beauty - we'll look like a guard escorting a late-arriving guest. But once inside..."

**Your Concern:**
"The Baron will recognize me instantly."

**Pieter's Solution:**
"Then we make sure you're in the Queen's presence before he can act. I know the layout. There's a musician's gallery overlooking the throne. If we time it right..."

### 9. Unexpected Ally

**Event [Rudolph arrives]:**
Pieter's friend Rudolph - huge, simple, but loyal - joins you.

**Rudolph's Offer:**
"I may be simple, but I'm not stupid. The Baron killed Duke Toresal. Bobby was my friend too. I'll help."

**The Team Forms:**
- You: The rightful heir with proof
- Pieter: The inside man with palace knowledge
- Rudolph: The muscle if things go wrong
- Fiona: The respectable chaperone

### 10. Final Preparations

**Pieter's Warnings:**
"The Baron's personal guard, Kristof - he's the dangerous one. Never leaves the Baron's side. Trained assassin."

"And there's rumors... the Princess has her own guards. Foreign mercenaries. No one knows where their loyalty lies."

**Your Questions:**
"What about after? Even if I reach the Queen, even if she believes me?"

**Pieter's Faith:**
"Your father inspired loyalty because he was just. Be yourself - the girl Bobby believed in - and the rest will follow."

### 11. The Plan Solidifies

**The Approach:**
- Enter through servants' entrance at half past nine
- Use musician's gallery to observe and wait
- When Queen enters, create a distraction
- Reach the Queen before Baron can interfere
- Present evidence publicly - make it impossible to ignore

**Contingencies:**
- If discovered early: Rudolph creates chaos
- If Baron acts first: You have the stiletto
- If escape needed: Pieter knows every exit

### 12. Evening Approaches

**Event [preparing to leave]:**
You stand in your mother's jewelry, your father's courage, and your own determination. Pieter offers his arm.

**Pieter's Vow:**
"Lady Toresal, I failed to protect your father. I won't fail his daughter."

**Your Response:**
"I'm not just his daughter. I'm the girl who survived the streets, who broke into the Baron's own estate, who earned Bobby's friendship. Tonight, I'm both."

**Final Moment:**
As your carriage rolls toward Lord's Keep, Pieter shares one last piece of intelligence:

"There's an old woman in the Small Woods. They say she has magic. Real magic. If we need to go through the woods to reach the Keep..."

You remember the secret entrance Bobby showed you. Another option, if the main plan fails.

The Keep looms ahead, blazing with lights. Somewhere inside, the Baron waits. The Queen decides. The Princess schemes.

And you? You're coming home.
