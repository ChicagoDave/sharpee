## Design

### 1. The Princess Enters

**Description:** Through a hidden door you didn't even know existed steps Princess Elizaveta. But this is not the pale, resigned woman from the ballroom. Her eyes are sharp, calculating. Behind her file mercenaries in foreign armor.

**The Princess Speaks:**
"Well, well. The mysterious Jacqueline Toresal. You've caused quite a commotion at my betrothal ball."

**Your Confusion:**
"Your Highness? I don't understand..."

**Her Smile:**
"Of course you don't. You've been playing a provincial game while the kingdom burns. But you've done me a service tonight."

### 2. The Princess's Revelation

**Her Explanation:**
"Did you think I wanted to marry that preening murderer? My mother thrust this match upon me. But now, with the Baron disgraced, wounded, fleeing... the betrothal is void."

**Your Hope:**
"Then you'll support my claim? Tell the Queen the truth?"

**Her Laugh:**
"Oh, my dear child. You still don't understand. I don't care about your provincial inheritance. I have bigger concerns."

### 3. The Larger Game

**The Princess's Agenda:**
"The kingdom fractures. The western clans grow bold. The eastern merchants plot rebellion. My mother grows senile. And you... you could be useful."

**Your Defiance:**
"I'm not a tool for your schemes."

**Her Assessment:**
"Aren't you? A girl with royal blood, raised in the streets, trained by spies, hardened by survival. You're exactly the tool the kingdom needs."

### 4. Pieter and Bobby React

**Event [Pieter moves to protect you]:**
"Stand back, Your Highness. Lady Jacqueline is under my protection."

**The Princess's Amusement:**
"A loyal guard. How quaint. Kristoff?"

**Her Bodyguard Acts:**
A giant of a man steps forward. Before Pieter can react, Kristoff strikes him down with casual efficiency.

**Bobby Tries to Rise:**
But he's too weak. He can only watch as events unfold.

### 5. The Kidnapping

**The Princess's Command:**
"Take her. Carefully. She's valuable."

**Your Resistance:**
You fight, but these aren't street thugs or Baron's mercenaries. These are professional soldiers. They subdue you with practiced ease.

**The Princess's Promise:**
"Don't struggle, cousin. Oh yes, I know exactly who you are. Your father was my uncle. That makes us family."

### 6. Family Secrets

**The Revelation Continues:**
"Your father could have been King, you know. But he chose love over duty. Married your mother instead of who the crown selected. My mother never forgave him."

**Your Shock:**
"The Queen... she knew?"

**Princess Elizaveta Nods:**
"From the beginning. Why do you think she let the Baron act? One problem eliminating another. But you survived. Interesting."

### 7. Bobby's Desperate Plea

**Bobby from the Floor:**
"Jack! Whatever she wants, don't—"

**The Princess Silences Him:**
"The spy speaks? I thought we'd hanged you. No matter. You've served your purpose."

**To Her Men:**
"Leave him. Leave them all. We have what we came for."

### 8. The Journey Begins

**Event [Being Dragged Away]:**
As the mercenaries pull you toward the secret passage, you manage one look back. Bobby struggling to rise. Pieter unconscious or worse. Your triumph turned to disaster.

**The Princess's Commentary:**
"Don't look so tragic. You've won, in a way. The Baron is finished. Your lands are yours. But you... you belong to a bigger game now."

### 9. Through Secret Ways

**Description:** The passage leads down, down into parts of the Keep you never knew existed. Ancient stones, older than the current castle.

**The Princess Explains:**
"Every royal residence has these ways. Known only to the blood. Your father should have taught you, but then, he always was too trusting."

### 10. The Underground Dock

**Surprising Discovery:**
The passage opens onto an underground river. A sleek boat waits, manned by more foreign soldiers.

**Your Question:**
"Where are you taking me?"

**Her Answer:**
"To meet your grandmother. Oh, didn't you know? The Queen is your father's mother. That makes you her granddaughter. My cousin. Royal blood, whether she acknowledges it or not."

### 11. The Bigger Picture

**The Princess's Plan:**
"The kingdom needs strength. Not the Baron's brutality, but real strength. You've proven you can survive anything. With proper training, proper guidance..."

**Your Defiance:**
"I won't be your puppet."

**Her Smile:**
"Puppet? No. Partner, perhaps. Or rival. That remains to be seen."

### 12. Last Glimpses

**Event [The boat launches]:**
As you're forced aboard, you hear commotion above. Shouts, running feet. They're looking for you.

**The Princess Unconcerned:**
"Let them search. By the time they think to check the old ways, we'll be long gone."

**Your Desperate Hope:**
Will Bobby survive? Will Pieter recover? Will the maidens be safe? Will your inheritance stand without you there to claim it?

### 13. A New Understanding

**The Princess Studies You:**
"You know, you look like him. Your father. Same stubborn jaw. Same defiant eyes. He never knew when he was beaten either."

**Your Response:**
"He wasn't beaten. He was murdered."

**Her Agreement:**
"Yes. And now his murderer runs bleeding through the night. Justice of a sort. But tell me - what will you do with your justice? Your inheritance? Your life?"

### 14. The Challenge

**The Princess Proposes:**
"Come with me willingly. Learn what your father never taught you. Become what the kingdom needs. Or resist, and watch from afar as everything burns."

**Your Dilemma:**
Everything you fought for is behind you. But ahead... ahead might be the power to truly change things. Or it might be a prettier prison.

### 15. The Cliffhanger

**Event [The boat enters a tunnel]:**
Darkness swallows you. The last light of the Keep disappears. You're leaving everything you know.

**The Princess's Final Words:**
"Welcome to the great game, Jacqueline Toresal. Your education begins now."

**Your Silent Vow:**
You'll learn. You'll grow stronger. And someday, somehow, you'll return. The Baron may be defeated, but your story is far from over.

**Final Image:**
The boat glides into darkness. Behind, the Keep blazes with light and chaos. Ahead, only shadow and possibility.

Bobby's voice echoes in your memory: "Choose your path."

You didn't choose this. But you'll make the most of it.

The street thief is gone. The Duke's daughter is captured.

But Jacqueline Toresal? She's just beginning.
