## Design

### 1. Maiden House - Front Room

**Description:** The familiar warmth of the Maiden House wraps around you like a blanket. The front room is simple but clean, with mended furniture and fresh flowers in a cracked vase on the table. But something feels different - the maidens are all here, waiting, their faces grave.

**Event [entering for the first time after escaping mercenaries]:** 
Angeline rises from her chair the moment you enter. "Jacqueline," she says - using your real name for the first time in years. "Thank the Goddesses you're safe. Quickly, child. We haven't much time."

### 2. NPCs: The Maidens

**Angeline:** 
- **Description:** The plump widow who's always been kind to you looks different now - there's steel in her eyes you've never noticed before.
- **Dialogue:** "We've been preparing for this day, though we prayed it would never come."

**Clara:**
- **Description:** Even uptight Clara seems shaken, wringing her hands nervously.
- **Dialogue:** "The mercenaries have been here twice already, searching. They'll be back."

**Fiona:**
- **Description:** Your tutor watches you with sad, knowing eyes.
- **Dialogue:** "There's so much we need to tell you, and so little time."

**Theresa:**
- **Description:** For once, suspicious Theresa isn't glaring at you.
- **Dialogue:** "I may not like you, girl, but even I won't let those monsters have you."

**Shannon:**
- **Description:** Sweet Shannon is crying quietly in the corner.
- **Dialogue:** "Oh, Jack... I mean, Jacqueline... we should have told you sooner."

### 3. The Secret Room

**Event [being led to safety]:**
Fiona moves to the fireplace and presses a specific brick. With a grinding sound, a section of the wall swings inward, revealing a hidden room.

**Description:** The secret room is small but well-appointed, with a narrow bed, a chest, and shelves lined with books. A single candle provides flickering light. Most surprisingly, there's a portrait on the wall - a beautiful woman with your eyes.

**Command [look at portrait]:** 
"Your mother," Fiona says softly. "Lady Catherine. She was... extraordinary."

### 4. The Truth About Mother

**Fiona's Revelation:**
"Your mother was a healer, did you know that? Not just with herbs and poultices, but with true magic. Small magics, but real ones. She could ease pain with a touch, mend small wounds with her songs."

"Duke Toresal met her when she healed him after a hunting accident. He was already married - a political match arranged by the Queen - but he fell deeply in love with Catherine."

"When you were born, your mother made us promise to keep you safe. She knew... somehow she knew she wouldn't survive the birth. Her last magic was ensuring you lived."

### 5. The Maidens' Secret

**Angeline speaks:**
"We're not just widows taking in orphans, child. Each of us was placed here by your father. Fiona was your mother's friend. Clara served in the Duke's household. I was your mother's midwife. Even Theresa, for all her complaints, was chosen to watch over you."

**Theresa adds grudgingly:**
"I don't like that you were born with advantages the other orphans lacked. But you're still one of our charges. And we protect our own."

### 6. Your Father's Plan

**Fiona continues:**
"Your father couldn't acknowledge you publicly - the Queen forbade it. But he made sure you were educated, protected, prepared. He left documents, hidden away, that prove your parentage. Proof that you are the rightful heir to his lands."

"He always hoped that one day, when you were older, when the political situation changed... he could bring you to court. But then he fell ill."

**Clara interjects:**
"Poisoned. We're certain of it now. The Baron's doing."

### 7. The Immediate Danger

**Angeline takes charge:**
"The mercenaries will return. You can't stay here long. But there are things you must know, things you must have."

**She hands you an old key:**
"This opens a box in the Red Gate Estate - your father's house. The proof of your birth is there. But it's dangerous to go there now."

**Fiona adds:**
"There's another way. Baron Fossville doesn't know about your father's private study in Black Gate Estate. When he took over the property, he never found it. The entrance is through the garden, beneath the statue of the mermaid."

### 8. Preparing for What's Next

**Event [sounds of mercenaries outside]:**
Heavy boots echo in the street outside. Angeline quickly pushes you back toward the secret room.

**Final Instructions:**
- **Angeline:** "Stay hidden until full dark. We'll tell them you never returned."
- **Fiona:** "Remember - the mermaid statue in the Baron's garden. Your father hid everything there."
- **Clara:** "Be careful who you trust. The Baron has spies everywhere."
- **Shannon:** "We love you, dear one. Be safe."
- **Theresa:** "Don't get caught, you stupid girl. We've invested too much in you."

**Event [hiding in the secret room]:**
Through the thin walls, you hear the mercenaries storm in, shouting and throwing furniture. The maidens play their parts perfectly - confused, frightened old women who haven't seen you in days.

After what feels like hours, Fiona returns to let you out. "They're gone. But they'll be watching the house. You'll need to leave through the cellar tunnel."

"Jack... Jacqueline... whatever happens next, know that your mother would be proud of the young woman you've become. As are we all."

[This leads to Chapter VI - Jack's capture while trying to leave the city]
