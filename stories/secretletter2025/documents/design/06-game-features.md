## Time Keeping

The setting must have night and day characteristics.

Room locations should note light regarding the sun and moon where appropriate.

Room locations should note crowdedness based on the time of day. For instance, the markets are crowded during the day and empty at night.

We should be able to easily enough implement "wait for darkness" or "wait until morning". This could potentially be an extension.
