## Design

### 1. Return to Maiden House

**Description:** Dawn is breaking as you stumble back to Maiden House. Your clothes are torn, you're covered in garden dirt and sewer muck, but clutched against your chest are the precious documents. The house seems quieter than usual.

**Event [entering]:**
The door opens before you can knock. Angeline stands there, tears streaming down her face. "Oh, child," she says, pulling you inside. "You're too late. Bobby... Bobby is gone."

### 2. The News of Bobby's Death

**The Maidens Gathered:**
They're all in the front room, dressed in black. Even Theresa's eyes are red from crying.

**Fiona speaks softly:**
"They hanged him at dawn. In the public square. He... he died bravely. Refused the hood. Looked straight at the crowd and shouted 'Long live the true heir of Toresal' before they..."

**Shannon sobs:**
"He was just a boy. Just a boy doing his duty."

**Clara adds:**
"The Baron was there. Watched the whole thing with a smile. Monster."

### 3. Sharing the Discoveries

**Event [showing the documents]:**
"He didn't die for nothing," you say, pulling out the papers. "Look what I found. What Bobby died to help me find."

**The maidens examine everything:**
- **Angeline** reads the recognition letter with shaking hands
- **Fiona** studies the evidence of poison with professional interest
- **Clara** checks the legal documents with her sharp eye for detail
- **Theresa** counts the money with grim satisfaction
- **Shannon** weeps over the love letters

### 4. The Full Truth Revealed

**Angeline takes charge:**
"Now that you have proof, there are things we must tell you. Things we swore to keep secret until this day."

**The Network:**
"Your father didn't just arrange for us to watch you. There's a whole network - merchants, guards, even some nobles who remained loyal to him. They've been waiting, watching, preparing for the day you could claim your birthright."

**Fiona's Revelation:**
"I wasn't just your tutor, Jacqueline. I was your mother's cousin. That makes us family, truly. I've been teaching you more than just letters and history - I've been preparing you to rule."

**Clara's Confession:**
"I served in your father's household for twenty years. I was there the night you were born, the night your mother died. She made us all swear a blood oath to protect you."

**Theresa's Admission:**
"Fine, I'll say it. I was jealous. My husband left me with nothing, and here you were, born to everything. But watching you these years... you never acted entitled. Never lorded it over the others. You've earned your inheritance."

**Shannon's Gift:**
"I saved this for you," she says, producing a small locket. "It was your mother's. She wore it always. Inside is a miniature of your father."

### 5. Red Gate Estate

**Angeline explains:**
"Red Gate Estate was your father's private residence. The Baron couldn't seize it because of old laws - it can only pass to blood family. It's been sealed these three years, waiting for you."

**Clara produces an iron key:**
"We've kept this safe. The estate is yours by right, but it's dangerous to go there. The Baron has surely set watchers."

**Fiona suggests:**
"But if you must go - and I know you must - don't go as Jack the street boy. Go as Lady Jacqueline Toresal."

### 6. The Plan for Transformation

**Angeline takes charge:**
"First, a bath. You smell like you've been swimming in the sewers."

**Event [being cleaned up]:**
For the first time in three years, you let the maidens fuss over you completely. The dirt and grime wash away, revealing the young woman underneath.

**Discoveries:**
- Your hair, when clean and combed, falls past your shoulders
- Your face, without dirt, shows your mother's delicate features
- Your hands, though callused, have your father's long fingers
- You're taller than you realized, having grown while slouching

### 7. Lessons in Being a Lady

**Quick Reminders:**
- **Fiona:** "Remember your posture. Shoulders back, chin up."
- **Clara:** "A lady doesn't stride, she glides."
- **Angeline:** "Your voice - let it find its natural pitch."
- **Shannon:** "Smile like your mother did - with your eyes."
- **Theresa:** "Don't simper. You're a Duke's daughter."

### 8. The Royal Ball Revelation

**Clara shares intelligence:**
"The ball is tonight. The Queen has arrived. The Baron plans to announce his betrothal to Princess Elizaveta."

**Fiona's Insight:**
"But if you were to appear - with proof of your identity - in front of the Queen herself..."

**Angeline nods:**
"The Queen remembers your father fondly. She opposed his match with your mother, but she respected him. If she knew what the Baron did..."

### 9. Preparing for Red Gate Estate

**What You'll Need:**
- Proper clothing (the maidens have saved some of your mother's dresses)
- The estate key
- The documents proving your identity
- Money for bribes if needed
- An escort (one of the maidens will come)

**Fiona volunteers:**
"I'll come with you. As your cousin, I have the right. And you'll need someone who remembers the estate as it was."

### 10. Bobby's Legacy

**Event [quiet moment]:**
Shannon brings you something else - a letter in Bobby's hand.

**Bobby's Letter:**
"If you're reading this, then I'm probably dead and you finally know the truth. I wanted to tell you so many times. You were never just an assignment to me, Jack. You were my friend. My purpose.

Watch out for Pieter at the jeweler's shop. He's one of us. Trust the Sandlers - they knew your mother. And remember - you're not just Duke Toresal's daughter. You're the girl who saved my worthless life a dozen times in the streets. That's the ruler Toresal needs.

Don't mourn me too long. I chose my path. Now choose yours.

Your friend always,
Bobby"

### 11. Final Preparations

**Angeline's Blessing:**
"Your mother would be so proud. Your father too. You've grown into everything they hoped."

**Theresa's Warning:**
"The Baron knows you have the documents now. He'll be desperate. Watch yourself."

**Clara's Advice:**
"At the estate, look for your father's study. He kept copies of everything. There may be more we don't know about."

**Shannon's Tears:**
"Be careful, dear one. We've already lost Bobby. We can't lose you too."

**Fiona's Determination:**
"Come, cousin. It's time to claim what's yours."

### 12. Leaving for Red Gate Estate

**Event [stepping outside]:**
You're dressed in one of your mother's simpler gowns - midnight blue, well-made but not ostentatious. Your hair is pinned up properly. You wear your mother's locket. In your hands is a small bag containing the precious documents.

For the first time in three years, you walk the streets as Jacqueline Toresal.

And everyone who sees you stops and stares, because despite the simple dress, despite the years of hiding, there's something unmistakably noble about you.

The game has changed. You're no longer hiding. You're hunting.
