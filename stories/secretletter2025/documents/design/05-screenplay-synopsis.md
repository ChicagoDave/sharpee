# The Screenplay

## SYNOPSIS

A young orphan girl pretending to be a boy discovers people are trying to kill her, that she is royal born, and that she must save herself by finding out as much information as possible, as well as proving that she is worthy of being recognized as the heir to the local lands.

1. Jack is chased by mercenaries and does not know why.

2. Jack has opportunities to talk to people about the environment. (Butcher, Baker, Armory, Moneylender, Jeweler, Clothier)

3. Jack meets Bobby. She returns to Maiden House for the evening, but sneaks out again to meet up with Bobby.

4. Bobby takes Jack to Lord's Keep. They find about the Queen's visit and the upcoming ball where the Baron will marry into the Royal Family.

5. Jack tries to get back through town to the woods and is captured. Bobby is beaten up badly in an adjacent cell. He whispers about secrets in Black Gate Estate, the in-town residence of Baron Fossville. Jack meets crooks that help her escape and tell her where to hide in the sewer.

6. Jack gets back to Maiden House, where the women hide her in a secret room. Here she learns about her mother.

7. Jack comes out of hiding and gets into Black Gate Estate. She finds out about her father, including the letter that recognizes her as heir.

8. Jack hears that Bobby has been hung and returns to Maiden House. The women open up about everything and tell her that the Red Gate Estate (previously her father's residence) is her home now, but dangerous to go there.

9. Jack gets into Red Gate Estate with key from maidens and one of the maidens coming with her. She finds artifacts about her father. She also finds fresh clothes and a bath. One of the maidens helps her bath and suggests she buy a new gown and to sneak into the ball to seek audience with the Queen.

10. Jack visits the moneylender and with the letter is able to take money out. Jack visits the clothier and jeweler to get ready for ball. Pieter decides to accompany her. Jack visits the armory and buys a stiletto knife and hides it in her bodice.

11. Jack and Pieter cannot enter Lord's Keep directly as the mercenaries are all stalling guard. Jack shows Pieter the secret entrance. On their way through the woods, an odd old woman approaches them. She cryptically offers Jack a potion. The potion makes Jack's hair grow out. They enter the Keep and filter into the ball room, uninvited. The Queen has not arrived yet.

12. The mercenaries start filtering into the Keep. They begin to recognize Jack and Pieter disappears. The Baron appears at Jack's side and holds her arm tightly. He walks her to the War Room.

13. Jack enters the War Room. Pieter is slumped on the floor, bound hand and foot. Several mercenaries glare at Jack menacingly. The Baron has the door guarded and sits down. He asks Jack what you're doing. Jack shows him the letter. He seems nervous, but confident. The Baron burns the letter in the fireplace and picks up his sword. He approaches. Suddenly there is an argument outside. A fight is heard. The door is knocked down and Bobby comes charging in. He fights a dual with the Baron.

14. Jack releases Pieter with your knife. He takes it and begins fighting mercenaries. The Baron knocks Bobby down and runs out of the room. The mercenaries follow, as do Pieter and Bobby. The Princess comes into the room from a secret passage. She has more mercenaries with her and they kidnap Jack.
