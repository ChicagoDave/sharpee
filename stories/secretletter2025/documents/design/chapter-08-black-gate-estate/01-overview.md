## Design

### 1. The Fossville Crypt

**Description:** The iron gates of the crypt hang open, creaking softly in the night breeze. Inside, stone sarcophagi bear the names of long-dead Fossvilles. The air is thick with the musty scent of old death and older secrets.

**Object: Hidden Lever**
- **Description:** Behind the largest sarcophagus, your fingers find what the hermit described - a lever disguised as part of the carved decoration.
- **Command [pull lever]:** Stone grinds against stone as a section of the floor slides away, revealing stone steps leading down into darkness.

### 2. The Tunnel to Black Gate

**Description:** This tunnel is different from the sewers - older, carved with purpose. The walls are smooth, the floor worn by centuries of secret footsteps. Your small lamp throws dancing shadows on the walls.

**Event [halfway through tunnel]:**
You hear voices above - guards patrolling the estate grounds. Their footsteps echo through the earth, and you freeze until they pass.

### 3. Garden Entrance

**Description:** The tunnel ends at another stone door. Through cracks around its edges, you smell night-blooming jasmine and hear the gentle splash of fountains.

**Event [emerging into garden]:**
You push the door open carefully and emerge behind a massive hedge. The gardens of Black Gate Estate spread before you - a maze of carefully manicured paths, exotic plants, and elaborate fountains. And somewhere among them, a mermaid statue holds your father's secrets.

### 4. The Garden Maze

**Description:** The Baron's gardens are extensive and confusing. Hedge walls twice your height create a labyrinth of green. Statues loom at intersections - warriors, beasts, mythical creatures. But no mermaid.

**Guard Patrols:**
- Guards with lanterns patrol regular routes
- You must time your movements, hiding behind hedges and statues
- Getting spotted means capture or worse

**Garden Features:**
- **The Rose Garden:** Blood-red roses with thorns like daggers
- **The Fountain Court:** Three fountains depicting conquest, power, and submission  
- **The Warrior's Walk:** Statues of famous killers and conquerors
- **The Poison Garden:** Plants with warning signs - deadly nightshade, hemlock, wolfsbane

### 5. Finding the Mermaid

**Event [reaching the center of the garden]:**
There she is. In a secluded grotto, surrounded by weeping willows, sits the mermaid statue. She's beautiful - carved from white marble, holding a trident, her tail curled around the base of a fountain that no longer flows.

**Description:** Unlike the Baron's other statues celebrating violence and power, the mermaid seems out of place. Peaceful. Sad. You realize with a start - this statue predates the Baron. This was your father's addition to the garden.

### 6. The Statue's Secret

**Command [examine statue closely]:**
The trident is loose in the mermaid's grip. The base shows signs of wear, as if it's been turned before.

**Command [push trident, then turn base clockwise as Bobby instructed]:**
The trident sinks into the statue with a soft click. As you turn the base, you hear mechanisms grinding inside the stone. The entire statue rotates, revealing a narrow opening behind it.

### 7. The Secret Room

**Description:** The room beyond is small but astonishing. Your father's secret study, untouched for three years. Dust motes dance in the light from your lamp. Books line the walls. A desk holds papers, an inkwell, a half-written letter.

**Important Discoveries:**

**Your Father's Journal:**
- Details his love for your mother, Catherine
- Describes your birth and his joy at having a daughter
- Chronicles his growing suspicions about the Baron
- Final entries mention feeling ill, suspecting poison

**Love Letters:**
- Between your father and mother
- Full of poetry, promises, and plans for your future
- Your mother's letter announcing her pregnancy
- Her final letter, written as she was dying, blessing you

**Official Documents:**
- Your birth certificate, signed and sealed
- Documents recognizing you as his heir
- Legal papers prepared to legitimize you when you came of age
- Bank documents showing accounts set aside for you

**The Critical Letter:**
- Sealed with the Duke's official seal
- Addressed "To Whom It May Concern"
- States clearly: "I, Duke William Toresal, do hereby recognize Jacqueline Toresal as my natural daughter and sole heir to all my lands, titles, and possessions..."
- Witnessed by three officials, including one still living

### 8. Evidence of Murder

**The Poison Research:**
- Notes about his illness matching symptoms of rare poison
- The Baron's name connected to purchase orders
- A chemist's analysis of wine residue finding traces of Corpsewort
- Timeline showing the Baron's visits coinciding with worse symptoms

**The Conspiracy:**
- Letters between the Baron and unknown parties
- Plans to marry into the royal family
- References to "removing obstacles"
- Your name on a list marked "to be eliminated"

### 9. Taking What You Need

**Decision Point:** You can't carry everything. What do you take?
- The official letter recognizing you as heir (essential)
- Evidence of the Baron's crimes (helpful for justice)
- Your parents' love letters (sentimental but precious)
- Money and jewels (practical for survival)

### 10. The Baron Returns

**Event [while gathering documents]:**
Shouts from the garden! Lanterns converging on the grotto. Someone has discovered the turned statue.

**The Baron's Voice:**
"The statue's been moved! Search everywhere! Find the intruder!"

**Escape Routes:**
- Back through the tunnel (but guards may be waiting)
- Through the house (dangerous but unexpected)
- Over the rooftops (requires climbing)
- Into the poison garden (dangerous but good cover)

### 11. Rooftop Escape

**Event [choosing rooftop route]:**
You stuff the most important documents inside your shirt and climb. The mermaid statue provides a boost to a low wall, from there to a trellis, then onto the roof proper.

**Rooftop Navigation:**
- Slate tiles, slippery with night dew
- Guards with crossbows in the courtyard below
- Jump between buildings
- Use chimney smoke for cover

### 12. Pursuit Across the Rooftops

**The Baron Himself:**
As you leap between buildings, you glimpse the Baron in the courtyard below. His face is twisted with rage as he shouts orders. "Find them! Check every room, every cellar! They have the letters!"

**Close Call:**
A crossbow bolt whistles past your ear. You slide down a roof, catch yourself on a gutter, swing into an open window...

### 13. Through the House

**Description:** You're in a servant's bedroom. Empty - the servants must be searching the grounds. You need to get out before they return.

**Quick Route:**
- Servants' stairs down
- Through the kitchen (grab food for later)
- Out the delivery entrance
- Into the city streets

### 14. Dawn Approaching

**Event [escaping into the city]:**
As you vanish into the pre-dawn shadows of the city, bells begin to ring. Four chimes. One hour until Bobby's execution.

You have the proof of who you are. You have evidence of the Baron's crimes. But what good is any of it if you can't save the one person who believed in you from the start?

**Decision:** Race to the execution to try to save Bobby? Or get the evidence to safety first?

[This leads to Chapter IX - Maiden House II, where Jack learns Bobby has been executed]
