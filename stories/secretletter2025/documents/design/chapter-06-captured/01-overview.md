## Design

### 1. The Capture

**Event [trying to leave the city]:**
You've barely made it three blocks from Maiden House when they spot you. Despite your disguise, despite keeping to the shadows, someone shouts "There! The boy!"

**Description:** The chase is brief but terrifying. You duck through alleys you know by heart, leap over barrels, squeeze through gaps too narrow for the armored mercenaries. But there are too many of them, and they know the city better than you thought.

**Event [capture]:**
You round a corner and run straight into the waiting arms of the mercenary captain. "Got you at last, little rat," he sneers, cuffing you hard across the face. The world spins, and darkness takes you.

### 2. City Jail - Cell

**Description:** You wake to the taste of blood and the stench of unwashed bodies. The cell is small and dank, with moldy straw on the floor and rusted bars on the door. A single barred window high on the wall lets in a shaft of pale light.

**Initial Inventory Check:** They've taken everything - your knife, your coins, even your boots. All you have left are your clothes, torn and dirty from the chase.

### 3. Bobby's Voice

**Event [after regaining consciousness]:**
"Jack?" The voice is weak, barely a whisper, but unmistakable. "Jack, is that you?"

**Description:** The voice comes from the cell next to yours, through a small gap where the stone has crumbled between cells.

**Command [look through gap/whisper to Bobby]:**
You can just make out Bobby's face through the gap. Or what's left of it. One eye is swollen shut, his lip is split, and dark bruises cover every visible inch of skin.

**Bobby's Whispered Message:**
"Knew... knew you'd end up here. Listen... don't have much time. They'll move me soon. To the square. For... for hanging."

"Black Gate Estate. The Baron's house. In the garden... statue of a mermaid. Your father... he hid... everything there. Proof. About you. About what the Baron did."

"Secret room. Behind the statue. Push the trident... then turn the base... clockwise. Remember... clockwise."

"Tell the maidens... tell them I tried. Tell them..."

**Event [guards approaching]:**
Heavy footsteps echo down the corridor. Bobby pulls back from the gap. "Quiet now. Don't let them know we talked."

### 4. The Criminals

**Event [being moved to common cell]:**
After what feels like hours, guards unlock your cell. "Can't have you talking to the spy," one grunts. "You'll be more comfortable with your own kind."

**Description:** The common cell is larger, holding about a dozen prisoners. They're a rough-looking bunch - thieves, cutpurses, and worse. They eye you like wolves sizing up a lamb.

### 5. NPCs: The Crooks

**Old Tom:**
- **Description:** A grizzled old thief with knowing eyes and scarred hands.
- **Initial Reaction:** "Well, well. Look what the guards dragged in. You're that boy the Baron's men have been turning the city upside down for."

**Fingers:**
- **Description:** A thin, nervous man with incredibly nimble fingers.
- **Dialogue:** "You're Duke Toresal's girl, ain't you? We heard rumors."

**Scar:**
- **Description:** A massive woman with a lattice of scars across her face.
- **Dialogue:** "The enemy of our enemy, eh Tom?"

### 6. An Unexpected Alliance

**Old Tom's Proposition:**
"Here's the thing, little miss. We've no love for the Baron. He's been squeezing this city dry, hanging honest thieves for petty crimes while he commits murder and calls it politics."

"Your father, now - he was a different sort. Turned a blind eye when folks needed to steal bread to eat. Kept the peace without breaking heads."

"So we'll help you. But you'll owe us a favor, someday. Agreed?"

### 7. The Escape Plan

**Fingers explains:**
"I've been working on these locks for weeks. Almost got them figured out. Tonight, when they bring the evening slop, we make our move."

**Scar adds:**
"I'll handle the guards. You just run when Tom tells you to run."

**Event [evening meal time]:**
The guard enters with the food bucket, keys jangling at his belt. In one fluid motion:
- Scar "accidentally" trips him
- Fingers lifts the keys
- Tom creates a distraction arguing about the food
- You slip out during the chaos

### 8. Through the Jail

**Description:** The jail corridors are a maze of cells and guard posts. Tom leads with surprising agility for his age, while Scar brings up the rear.

**Event [passing Bobby's cell]:**
You glimpse Bobby through the bars, barely conscious. You want to stop, to help, but Tom grabs your arm. "Can't save everyone, girl. He knew the risks."

### 9. The Sewer Entrance

**Description:** Tom leads you to a seemingly solid wall in the jail's basement. He pushes a specific stone, and a section swings open, revealing a tunnel.

**The Sewer Revelation:**
"The city's got secrets most folks never learn," Tom says, leading you into the tunnels. "These sewers run everywhere - under the jail, under the Baron's house, even under the Keep."

"There are safe places down here. Rooms where honest criminals can hide when the heat's on. Remember these marks—" He shows you symbols carved into the walls. "Follow them if you're ever in trouble."

### 10. A Parting Gift

**Event [reaching safe house]:**
Tom leads you to a dry chamber deep in the sewers. It's surprisingly clean, with supplies and even beds.

**Old Tom's Advice:**
"You'll be safe here for a few hours. But you can't stay. That boy Bobby - he's to hang at dawn. Public execution. The Baron's making an example of him."

"Now, we heard what he told you. About Black Gate Estate. Dangerous place, but if you're determined to go, there's a sewer entrance in the old cemetery. Comes up right in the Baron's garden."

"Whatever you're planning, girl, be careful. The Baron's got the whole city looking for you now. But maybe... maybe that's exactly what this city needs. Someone to look for him right back."

**Scar hands you a small knife:**
"Hide this better than you hid the last one. You'll need it."

**Fingers gives you a set of lockpicks:**
"In case you find any doors that need opening."

**Event [leaving the safe house]:**
Tom shows you the sewer route to the cemetery. "Remember, girl. You owe us now. When you come into your inheritance - if you survive - don't forget the folks who helped you when you had nothing."

"Now go. You've got a statue to find and a friend to save."
