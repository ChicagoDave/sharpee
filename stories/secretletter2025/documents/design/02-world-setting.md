# The World of Orphan

In this world there exists a single planet where humans live and magic is extremely rare. The world has large bodies of water and at least one land mass as of this history. This continent is known as Miradan and is loosely ruled by the Kingdom of Jais Del Brin.

## The People

The people of Jais Del Brin are generally farmers, fisherman, and townspeople. Commerce is rugged and local, and the Kingdom generally functions without much taxation. Royalty includes the King and Queen, Princes, Princesses, Dukes and Duchesses, Earls and Countess, Barons and Baronesses.

## Ascension

The Kingdom generally selects new Kings based bloodlines, but this is married to the fact that the vast majority of Kings have sired strong, popular, and healthy sons to ascend to the throne. The key here is popularity. The Kingdom has rarely had to think about succession and when it has, it has generally been between two strong choices, not a complete lack of strong choices.

In the absence of a strong and popular blood prince, the laws of the Kingdom state that the King or Queen must choose a successor. In the event of the death of the King and the Queen before a successor has been named, all of the primary royals will select a Regent to handle Kingdom affairs until a successor is selected by vote. Voting is weighted in that Princes and Princesses get ten votes, Dukes and Duchesses get five votes, Earls and Countesses get three votes, and Barons and Baronesses get a single vote. But again, the general public's opinion is taken into consideration before a successor is selected. A special People's Regent role has always been filled, but never used but for ceremony. The role in the case of an unclear successor is to poll the people and make known their wishes. Obviously, in certain circumstances, this could become a very dangerous and powerful role.

## Magic

### In People

Magic is known to exist and is treated respectfully by the general population. They consider it either lucky or unlucky to have good or bad things happen due to magic respectively. Everyone always dreams of some minor magic to help their daily lives, but almost no one goes in search of it. Life is hard and there is no time for such endeavors. Those people that have discovered a talent for magic generally keep it to themselves and help or hurt those as they would with any other talent. There is no general commerce in magic, but if a magic user is available, some may intrude to ask for a favor and offer some token in return. Magic tends to develop in women more than men, although an analysis of those with "talent" would show that girls are encouraged to look within and boys are not, so never develop whatever ability they may have. Girls with talent are considered blessed or cursed, depending upon their nature (if a girl is a trouble-maker, she's cursed...if a girl is kind, she is considered blessed).

Most magic is minor. Very little "grand magic" is know about or has ever been seen. The common uses of magic are to mend clothes, cure minor ailments, fix broken tools, and the like. On occasion a magic user will have more interesting abilities.

### In Things

There are artifacts that are imbued with magical ability, giving the owner of the artifact some magical ability, albeit focused and limited.

## Physics

The general physics of this world are the same as Earth.

## Astronomy

The night sky of this world is full of stars. One section of the sky that is seen in summer is a strip of very bright stars known commonly as "The River of Light". It also has two moons, one noticeably large than the other. They are known commonly as Big Sister and Little Brother.

## Recent History

The Realtic Kingdom has been seemingly healthy for hundreds of years, with successions going without any problem. But the last two kings have ruled poorly and the most recent king has left the land to an elderly queen, who only late in life realized she would need to rule and determine a successor. Although her children and grandchildren may vie for the crown, their particular fates have produced a great deal of concern from the public and the Lord's council as to their ability to rule.

Succession rights are simple where blood is concerned, but with so many inline, the fate of the kingdom is not so simply decided. It's almost a game or a sport. Whoever shows the Queen that they deserve it, and then garners public approval, will become the heir to the throne. Because the Kingdom has had such a peaceful history, the public would balk at a heavy-handed ruler.

Orphan is the story of a young girl that is at the top of the blood lines, along with many other potential successors. Her father was the last son born of the current queen, with seven siblings in front of him. Unfortunately, his fate was decided by Baron Fossville. Having seen the coming turmoil, he wished to vie for the thrown himself, and turned to dark means to attain it.

In the 756th year of the Kingdom, Baron Fossville managed to slowly poison Duke Toresal, making it look like a mysterious illness. What Fossville did not know until taking over the Duke's keep and lands was that the former Lord had bore a child with a woman in secrecy. Since the Duke was already married, the secret remained buried for years. But before his death, Duke Toresal left written claim to all of his estates to his only daughter. He had loved the woman that bore her, but could not openly recognize her or their child...a mandate from the Queen herself, since the woman was not of royal blood.

But his will left the door open for young Jacqueline, and this is her story....
