## Design

### 1. Approaching Red Gate Estate

**Description:** Red Gate Estate sits like a sleeping giant among lesser houses. The red brick walls that give it its name glow warm in the morning sun. The gates - actual red-painted iron - stand closed but not locked, merely waiting.

**Fiona observes:**
"Three years of dust and neglect, but still beautiful. Your father loved this place."

**Event [using the key]:**
The lock turns smoothly despite the years. The gates swing open with a groan, and you step onto the property that is yours by birthright.

### 2. The Grounds

**Description:** The gardens are overgrown but not wild - as if nature has been gently tending them in the gardeners' absence. Rose bushes bloom untrimmed, herbs run riot in what was once a kitchen garden, and fruit trees drop their bounty unpicked.

**Discoveries:**
- A child's swing hanging from an oak tree (yours, Fiona confirms)
- A small grave marked "Catherine's Garden" (your mother's herb garden)
- Carriage house with your father's personal carriage, covered in dust
- Stables, empty but for the lingering smell of hay

### 3. The Main House - Entry

**Description:** The front door opens to your key. Inside, white sheets cover furniture like ghosts. Dust motes dance in shafts of sunlight from tall windows. The air smells of cedar and old books and something indefinable - perhaps the lingering essence of happiness.

**Fiona's Memories:**
"Your father used to carry you on his shoulders through these halls. You'd laugh and pull his hair, and he'd pretend to be a horse."

### 4. Your Father's Study

**Description:** The study is exactly as he left it. Papers on the desk, a half-finished letter, a cold pipe in an ashtray. Portrait of your mother above the fireplace, painted when she was young and radiantly happy.

**Important Finds:**

**The Half-Finished Letter:**
"My dearest Jacqueline, By the time you read this, you will be old enough to understand. I have made arrangements for your protection, but I fear my time grows short. The Baron grows bolder, and I grow weaker. Know that everything I have done has been for you..."

**Financial Documents:**
- Substantial accounts in your name
- Deeds to properties throughout the kingdom
- Trade agreements worth fortunes
- All properly transferred to "Jacqueline Toresal, upon her majority"

**Strategic Information:**
- Maps of noble houses and their loyalties
- Notes on the Baron's weaknesses
- List of allies who can be trusted
- Blackmail material on various nobles

**Personal Items:**
- Your baby shoes
- A lock of your hair
- Drawings you made as a toddler
- A diary chronicling your early years

### 5. Your Mother's Rooms

**Description:** Fiona leads you to a suite of rooms kept exactly as your mother left them. Her clothes still hang in the wardrobe, her brushes still sit on the vanity, her books still mark her place.

**Fiona's Revelation:**
"Your father couldn't bear to change anything. He'd come here when he missed her most."

**Discoveries:**
- Your mother's jewelry box (containing pieces worth a fortune)
- Her magical implements (herbs, crystals, ceremonial items)
- Love poems your father wrote her
- A baby blanket she was embroidering with your initials

### 6. Your Nursery

**Description:** A room clearly prepared with love. Painted with fairy tale scenes, filled with toys and books. A beautiful cradle carved with protective runes. Everything waiting for a child who was taken away too soon.

**Event [emotional moment]:**
Fiona finds you crying in the nursery. "They loved you so much," you whisper.

"They still do," she replies. "Love like that doesn't die. It just waits."

### 7. The Hidden Vault

**Fiona's Knowledge:**
"Your father showed me once, in case something happened. Behind your mother's portrait in his study."

**Event [opening the vault]:**
Behind the painting, a safe contains:
- The ducal seal of office
- Crown jewels of Toresal
- Ancient documents proving the family's royal blood
- A letter from the Queen acknowledging your father's daughter
- Gold enough to buy an army

### 8. Transformation Continues

**The Bathing Chamber:**
- Hot water still flows from magical heating stones
- Scented soaps and oils your mother favored
- You wash away the last traces of Jack the street boy

**Your Mother's Wardrobe:**
- Gowns in rich fabrics, perfectly preserved
- Many in styles that won't be out of place at court
- Fiona helps you choose appropriate attire
- Everything fits as if made for you

**The Vanity:**
- Your mother's brushes and combs
- Cosmetics and perfumes
- Jewelry for every occasion
- Fiona teaches you the art of subtle enhancement

### 9. Preparing for the Ball

**Choosing the Gown:**
You select a gown of deep emerald silk that brings out your eyes. It's elegant but not ostentatious, rich but not gaudy. Perfect for a duke's daughter making her first appearance at court.

**The Jewelry:**
- Your mother's locket at your throat
- Emerald earrings that match the gown
- A circlet that marks you as nobility
- Your father's signet ring on a chain (too large for your finger)

**Final Touches:**
- Hair swept up in an elegant style
- A touch of color to lips and cheeks
- Your mother's perfume - jasmine and rose
- Hidden: the stiletto knife in your bodice

### 10. Discovering Allies

**Event [while preparing]:**
A knock at the door. Fiona checks carefully, then admits an elderly woman.

**Mrs. Sandler from the jewelry shop:**
"Lady Jacqueline! When I saw you walking through the streets, I knew this day had come. Your mother's necklace - I've kept it safe all these years."

She produces a spectacular ruby and diamond necklace.

"She left it for cleaning the week before... before she died. I've been waiting to return it to her daughter."

### 11. The Plan Forms

**Fiona suggests:**
"We can't simply walk into the ball. But Mrs. Sandler's son Pieter - Bobby mentioned him in his letter."

**Mrs. Sandler confirms:**
"Pieter serves as a guard, but his true loyalty was always to your father. He can get you inside. And once there, if you can reach the Queen before the Baron realizes..."

**The Risk:**
"The Baron will have his mercenaries there. The moment he sees you, he'll try to stop you."

**Your Determination:**
"Then we'll have to make sure the Queen sees me first."

### 12. Evening Falls

**Event [preparing to leave]:**
You stand before your mother's full-length mirror. The reflection shows not Jack the street thief, but Lady Jacqueline Toresal - noble, beautiful, dangerous.

**Fiona's Pride:**
"Your transformation is complete. But remember - underneath the silk and jewels, you're still the girl who survived the streets, who outwitted mercenaries, who broke into the Baron's own home. That strength is your true inheritance."

**Your Father's Sword:**
On the way out, you pass your father's sword mounted on the wall. On impulse, you take it down.

"You can't wear that to a ball," Fiona protests.

"No," you agree. "But I'll have it in the carriage. Just in case."

### 13. Departure for Destiny

**Event [leaving Red Gate Estate]:**
Your father's carriage has been hastily cleaned. The matched horses - kept by loyal servants - stand ready. You climb in, every inch the lady.

But your hand rests on the stiletto hidden in your bodice, and your eyes hold the hardness of the streets.

You are both Jack and Jacqueline now. The street thief and the duchess. The hunted and the hunter.

Tonight, at the royal ball, one way or another, the game ends.
