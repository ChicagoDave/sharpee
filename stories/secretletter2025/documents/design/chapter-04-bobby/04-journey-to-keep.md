# Chapter IV - Journey to Lord's Keep

## 4. Lord's Road

**Description:** 
The wide and well-paved Lord's Road runs from Toresal's North Market Gate straight north to Lord's Keep, a mile or so from the city. To the east are rolling pastures; to the west, broken ground and scrub.

**Command [go west from Lord's Road]:** 
There's nothing much in that direction but rocks and the occasional thornbush.

**Command [go north from Lord's Road while Bobby is following, first time]:** 
Bobby holds you back. "Forget it, Jack," he says. "That way just leads to the front gate, and the guards will chase you off. I know a better way," he says with a knowing smile, and looks towards the open field to the east.

**Command [go north from Lord's Road while Bobby is following, subsequent times]:** 
"Didn't you hear me?" Bobby asks, exasperated. "We need to go *east*."

## 5. Pasture

**Description:** 
This wide, open field is used by the city for tourneys and other holiday events, or by cattle-sellers driving their livestock to market. Tonight it is empty except for the occasional cow pie. To the north you can see the dark, rough edge of a forest.

### Object: Cow Pie
**Description:** 
Last time you checked, cow pies pretty much all looked the same.

**Command [smell or take cow pie]:** 
Um, *yuck.*

**Event [first time you enter the Pasture while Bobby is following]:** 
You feel nervous and exposed out here in all this empty space; you're more used to the narrow alleys and enclosing walls of the city. The urge to hunch over and make yourself small is near-irresistable.

Bobby, meanwhile, strides out into the middle of the moonlit field, standing straight and swinging his arms wide. "Fresh air, Jack!" he calls out, laughing. "Enjoy it! Take a deep breath!"

**Command [smelling while in the Pasture]:** 
Mostly you smell cow pies.

## 6. Stream

**Description:** 
A small stream bubbles out of the woods and cuts through the pasture's north end. The edge of the forest lies to the north, just across the water. The city is far away to the south.

### Backdrop Object: Stream 
[located at Stream and adjacent Small Woods]

**Description:** 
The water is clean and clear, rippling over a shallow bed of stones and splashing over the larger rocks. It's only about ten feet wide here; you could probably pick your way across.

**Command [drink water]:** 
The water is fresh and shockingly cold.

**Command [swim or dive into stream]:** 
The water is only about shin-deep here; better for wading than for swimming.

**Command [going north from Stream/going south from Small Woods/crossing the stream while Jack is following, first time]:** 
Jack hops nimbly across, bouncing from rock to rock as though he were playing a game of "circles and stones" back in the city. He doesn't get so much as the hem of his cloak damp. When he gets to the opposite bank, he turns and beckons you to follow.

The first couple of rocks are easy enough, but the third one wobbles when you put your weight on it. You end up pinwheeling your arms desperately, contorting yourself in every direction to avoid a tumble and a thorough soaking. Finally, with arms outstretched and lower lip clamped between your teeth, you pick your way across the remainder of the stream with all the grace of a drunkard on a greased tightrope.

By the time you reach the opposite shore, Bobby is nearly doubled over with silent laughter. He claps you on the back. "You're a good sport, Jack," he says. "C'mon, we're nearly there."

**Programmer's Note:** [CROSS STREAM should divert to going north or south, depending on which location the player is in.]

## 7. Small Woods

**Description:** 
You are in the woodlands just southeast of Lord's Keep, following the game trails that wind their way through stands of pale birch and black, spruce. There is just enough moonlight trickling through the upper branches to see your way by. [if the player is adjacent to the Stream]A bubbling stream flows out of the forest to the south, into an open pasture.
