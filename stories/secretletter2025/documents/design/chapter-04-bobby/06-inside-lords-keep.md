# Chapter IV - Inside Lord's Keep

## 11. Chapel

**Event [first time you enter the room, from the secret door]:** 
Bobby jams his torch into a rusted bracket on the tunnel wall and steps through the secret door, gesturing you to follow. A prickle runs down your back as you step through after him. Are you really sneaking into the *Lord's Keep?* You're not even sure what the punishment for that is... something a lot worse than a few days in jail, certainly.

**Description:** 
The chapel of the Goddesses is a spacious, octagonal room, empty of furniture. The wood-paneled walls glow warmly, reflecting the light from dozens of devotional candles; the high ceiling disappears in the shadows overhead. A corridor leads southwest, and a secret passage in the south wall leads into subterranean gloom.

**Command [going south before listening twice in the Guardhouse]:** 
"Come on," Bobby whispers, pulling at your arm, "you don't want to go yet, we just got here. Let's explore some more." His eyes twinkle, and he gives you that smile that always says, *trust me this will be fun,* but usually means, *if running pell-mell for safety with your heart in your throat and the Lord's Guard on your heels is your idea of 'fun'.*

### Object: Devotional Candles
**Description:** 
The candles sit on little shelves built into the otherwise bare walls. It is traditional to light a candle when offering a prayer to one of the Goddesses; each of these wavering points of light is someone's hope, a wish, a dream.

**Command [take or extinguish a candle]:** 
That would be sacrilege!

## 12. Lower Bailey

**Description:** 
A thick wedge of shadow falls across the courtyard at the base of the Keep's outer wall, providing a relatively safe place to hide. The rest of the courtyard is flooded with moonlight, and bored-looking guards stroll back and forth over the gravel.

### Object: Stone Stairs
**Initial Appearance:** 
Steep stone steps climb up to the top of the wall. You could make a dash up them, if you timed it right.

**Command [go up the stairs]:** 
You wait, watching the nearest guard until he turns and begins walking away, then sprint lightly up the steps.

### NPC: Guards
**Description:** 
The Lord's Guards are dressed in polished mail and tabards emblazoned with the Toresal coat of arms, and each one wears a hefty sword at his hip. Fortunately, they haven't noticed you. Yet.

**Command [do anything to the guards]:** 
There must be less painful, though probably few quicker, ways of getting yourself killed.

## 13. Upper Bailey

**Description:** 
At the top of the wall you can lean out over the parapets and take in all the lands surrounding Toresal. It's a nice view, but torches set every few yards along the wall make this a dangerous spot to linger in. Stairs lead down into the courtyard below, and a dark archway opens to the north.

### Object: Torches
**Command [doing anything, even examining, the torches]:** 
If you get anywhere near those torches, you'll be spotted in no time. Best to stay low and in the shadows.

### Object: Toresal (view)
**Description:** 
The city is a pile of shadows in the distance, lit here and there with pinpricks of light: a guardsman carrying a torch, perhaps, or some night-owl sitting by the window with a lantern. Seeing it makes you realize just how absurd is your current predicament: you would be *safe* back in the city, snug in your bunk in Maiden House, or even skulking around the alleyways you know so well. Instead, you're breaking into Lord's Keep, sneaking along its walls, one slip-up away from getting yourself arrested or worse.

**Command [doing anything to the city view other than examining it]:** 
Unfortunately, the city is too far away.

## 14. Guardhouse

**Description:** 
A narrow antechamber, with an open archway to the south and an iron-reinforced door to the north. Arrow slits to either side lend the door an important and dangerous air.

**Event [when you first enter this room with Bobby]:** 
Bobby creeps forward and presses himself against the wall next to one of the arrow slits. He hunches closer, peering around the slit's edge. Then he looks up at you and smiles. He points at you, points at the arrow slit, then taps his ear. *Listen*, he's telling you.

### Object: Door
**Description:** 
The door is big and tough-looking, with bands of riveted iron across its thick wooden planks.

**Command [knock on or open door]:** 
Bobby waves you off with an incredulous look. *Are you NUTS?* his eyes seem to ask.

### Object: Arrow Slit
**Description:** 
The arrow slits are rectangular holes in the wall, about two inches high and six inches wide. Someone on the inside could stick the end of a crossbow in there and fire at anyone out here, all the while being totally protected by the wall. Fortunately, no one is manning the slits right now.

From here, you can see flickering firelight through the arrow slit, and hear voices on the other side.

**Command [search or look through arrow slit]:** 
Bobby puts his hand on your chest, holding you back. He shakes his head. *Not so close. Too dangerous.*

### Eavesdropping on the Guards

**Command [listen to arrow slit, first time]:** 
You can hear several voices coming from the room on the other side of the arrow slit -- guards relaxing on break, probably.

"...and I says, I don't care *who* hired you, people are tryin to do honest business here, and you're steppin on toes. Take yer men and hit the road, or else you can continue searchin for yer urchin boy in the city jail. And this tough fellow, him so hard with his sword and his scars and all, he just starts to cry, blubberin like a frightened scullery maid!"

"Haw! Yer lyin, so you are!"

"Goddesses witness, tis the truth! I could hardly credit it meself, and I wasn't that impressed with the man to begin with. Go on, I says, and gave him a boot to the arse to send him on his way."

There is general laughter. You glance at Bobby, but he motions you to keep listening.

**Command [listen to arrow slit, second time]:** 
"You seen tomorrow's detail yet?"

"Yeah, dress-up duty. Polishing helmets so we can look all pretty for the lords and ladies coming down to Baron Fussypants' ball."

"Not just lords and ladies, I heard. Word has it the Queen herself is on the guest list, and she's expected to appear."

"Oh, pull the other one."

"Goddesses witness it. They say she's comin down with her daughter in tow, that's why Fossville's hosting the ball in the first place. He's trying to get in the Queen's good graces, he wants to marry the girl."

"What, the Queen?"

"No, you dim. He wants to marry the *Princess.* Our Lord Fussypants is trying to position himself for the throne."

"Well, he's welcome to it, long as I'm paid at week's end. Of course, I'm not looking forward to spending a night standing at attention for a horde of fancy, feathered fops to goggle and gaggle at, but I guess it's better than latrine duty..."

Bobby pulls you away. He's grinning, his eyes wide and his eyebrows cocked. *Isn't it great?*

But you're too nervous to care. There are who knows how many men of the Lord's Guard right on the other side of that door. Someone could walk out at any second. You grab Bobby's arm and give it a firm yank -- *It's time to go.*

**Command [going south from the Guardhouse before listening twice]:** 
Bobby motions you back, pointing at the arrow slit again. There's something he obviously wants you to hear.
