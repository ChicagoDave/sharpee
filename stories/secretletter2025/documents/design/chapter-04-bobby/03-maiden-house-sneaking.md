# Chapter IV - Maiden House and Sneaking Out

## 3. Entrance to Maiden House

**Description:** 
The alley dead-ends in a small courtyard surrounded by old, run-down buildings.

### Object: Wooden Door
**Initial Appearance (from the alley):** 
A battered wooden door provides entrance into the southern building.

**Initial Appearance (from inside):** 
The front door is [open/closed].

**Description (from the alley):** 
There's no sign, but you know it well nonetheless -- this is the door to Maiden House, your "home". It is currently [open/closed].

**Description (from inside, when it's closed):** 
The front door is closed and locked -- and it will stay locked until sunup. The Maidens give you much of latitude generally, but curfew is one of the few rules they never, ever bend.

## Night Meeting with Bobby

### In Grubber's Market
**Initial Appearance [in Grubber's Market, after dark]:** 
Bobby is standing in the middle of Grubber's Market, under the shadow of the center pole. When he sees you he jogs over quietly and puts his hand on your arm.

"Had a spot of trouble getting away from the Maidens, eh, Jack?" he whispers.

"Yeah, some," you shrug. Not really, but maybe Bobby will be impressed if he thinks you made a daring escape.

Bobby smiles. "Well, you made it. Nice and tricky. Now come with me, keep your hood up, your head down, and land your feet soft. We're going to the Lord's Wood. That place I wanted to show you is there. You game?"

He points north, to the road leading out of the city.

**Programmer's Note:** [from the time the player meets Bobby in Grubber's Market to the time the player gets captured at the end of this scene, Bobby automatically follows the player wherever she goes.]

### Bobby While Sneaking

**Description [after dark, while sneaking to Lord's Keep]:** 
Bobby is being more careful than usual; his eyes dart towards every shadow, and he pauses often to listen for some noise you can't here. But when he glances at you, his eyes still twinkle with his happy-go-lucky spirit, and he smirks as though nothing could possibly go wrong.

**Initial Appearance [after dark, while sneaking to Lord's Keep]:** 
Bobby is here, waiting for you.

### Movement Restrictions

**Command [going east from the Grubber's Market after meeting Bobby there]:** 
Bobby puts his hand on your arm. "Where you going, Jack?" he asks, chuckling. "You're not losing your nerve, are you? We need to go that way." He jerks his thumb north.

**Command [climbing the center pole when Bobby is with you]:** 
Bobby grabs your belt and pulls you back to the ground. "We don't have time for that," he whispers. "Now let's hit the road," he says, nodding his head towards the north end of the market.

### Idle Behavior [while sneaking to the Lord's Keep]:
- "Come on, Jack," Bobby whispers, "we need to hurry."
- Bobby looks around nonchalantly.
- "We should head that way," Bobby says, pointing [direction of the shortest path towards the Guard House].
- Bobby grins at you. "Fun, yeah?" he says.

**Command [moving to another location while Bobby is following]:** [pick one at random]
- Bobby follows close behind you.
- Bobby saunters along next to you.
- Bobby hurries ahead to scout the way, then waits for you to catch up.

**Command [talking to Bobby while going to the Keep]:** 
Bobby waves your question away. "Time for talk later," he says. "Let's get to where we're going, first."

### Bobby in the Tunnel/Keep

**Description [while Bobby is with you in the tunnel or in the Keep]:** 
For the first time since you set out, Bobby looks a little bit nervous. He checks over his shoulder constantly, and urgently gestures you to keep moving.

**Idle Behavior [while in the tunnel or in the Keep]:
- Bobby looks around nervously.
- "Come on," Bobby whispers, "we need to hurry."
- Bobby walks ahead a bit and checks out the area to the [direction towards Guardhouse if you haven't listened there yet; otherwise back towards the fountain]. Then he hurries back to you. "It's clear," he whispers, "we should go."

**Command [moving to a new location in the tunnel or in the Keep, while Bobby is with you]:** 
Bobby sticks close to you.

**Command [talking to Bobby while in the tunnel or in the Keep]:** 
Bobby shakes his head and puts his finger to his lips.
