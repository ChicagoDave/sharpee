# Chapter IV - The Secret Entrance

## 8. Clearing

**Description:** 
The woods open out here in a small, moonlit clearing.

### Object: The Fountain

**Initial Appearance:** 
The ruins of an old pavilion lie here, pale pavestones poking up like bones from the grass. In the center of it stands a crumbling fountain, topped by a cracked statue of Brigid pouring an urn.

**Description:** 
The fountain is shaped like a large bowl, topped with a classical-style statue of Brigid pouring water from an urn. Of course, the fountain is dry now, its stone cracked, the bowl filled with bird droppings and dead leaves. But at one time it must have been very beautiful.

[if the secret door is open, add:] One side of the stone plinth supporting the statue, part of the stone is slid away, revealing a narrow opening into darkness.

**Command [enter fountain]:** 
[this should be construed as entering the secret door]

### Object: Statue (part of fountain)
**Description:** 
The statue's features are worn away and obscured by moss, but you've seen enough statues of Brigid to know that she's almost always depicted carrying water.

### Opening the Secret Entrance

**Event [when you arrive at the fountain with Bobby]:** 
"Here we are." Bobby jumps up into the bowl of the fountain, dried leaves crackling beneath his boots. Then he reaches around the statue of Brigid as though trying to embrace her. His hands fumble at something on the underside of the urn.

Suddenly there is a deep, solid *thunk*, and a scraping sound. And part of the base of the statue *moves*.

Bobby hops down and pushes against the statue's base. A rectangle of stone about two feet square swings inward on protesting hinges. The space behind it is utterly black, and a cold, draft of damp-smelling air rises out of it.

"It runs all the way to Lord's Keep," says Bobby as he brushes off his hands. "I don't think anyone knows about it. Maybe Lord Toresal did, but now that he's dead it's basically unknown. It's not been used for decades, I'd guess. Well anyway, until now, that is."

He holds out his hand. His lop-sided smile is absolutely charming. "After you, kind sir."

### The Capture

**Event [arriving from below, after you've listened at the Guard house, before the room description]:** 
You crawl out of the hole in the base of the statue, into the dirt and leaves littering the bottom of the fountain. Apart from your scrabbling, it's quiet out here -- very quiet. Even the crickets have stopped, you realize.

Finally, you get to your feet and look around.

Bobby is lying face-down in the grass, just a few yards away. One of the mercenaries from Grubber's Market is kneeling with his knee in the small of Bobby's back, binding his wrists together with twine. Standing around the outside of the fountain are several more mercenaries, looking relaxed and smug. Some of them are chuckling to themselves.

A gaunt man wearing red robes walks up to you. His mouth is half-hidden by long, drooping, black moustaches, but underneath them he is smiling like a snake. "Well now, young...sir? Or is it 'miss'? So much confusion, all to catch one little mouse. You led us a merry chase this morning, little mouse, but I think you will not scurry away from us again."

Leaves crunch behind you. You jump for it, but too slow -- rough hands haul you back, and a sack of coarse, black cloth is pulled over your head.

"Good night, little mouse."

Something hard and heavy strikes the back of your head, and the night turns black as pitch.

## 9. Underneath the Fountain

**Event [first time you enter the location, before the room description]:** 
You grope your way down into the tunnel, carefully sliding your feet over steps you cannot see. Echoes fill the darkness: the scrape of your shoes on stone, the drip of water, your own loud breathing.

Behind you, you hear Bobby fumbling with something under his cloak; the *click* of stone on metal; and then a sickly orange glow spreads across the walls of the tunnel. Your own shadow wobbles hugely in front of you.

You turn around and see Bobby holding a torch. He grins at you. "Tricky, isn't it?"

**Event [arriving from the north, before the room description]:** 
Stealthily, you creep back up the long tunnel.

**Description:** 
The walls and floor are old, damp, and spotted with some sort of whitish fungus, and the air has a wet, sour smell to it. Steps lead up to the fountain above you. To the north, a long, low-ceilinged tunnel leads into the gloom.

**Command [going up without having listened at the Guardhouse yet]:** 
Bobby pulls you back. "Aw, come on, Jack," he says, "don't chicken out *now.*"

**Event [arriving at the Clearing from below, if you have listened at the Guardhouse, before room description]:** 
"I'll go first," whispers Bobby, "to make sure the coast is clear." He dunks his torch in a puddle of mud and bounds lightly up the steps. For a moment you can see him silhouetted against the starlight; then he moves away from the opening and disappears from view.

You wait for ten heartbeats. Behind you, you hear the distant *plip* of dripping moisture, far back in the dark tunnel. Above you, you can hear crickets chirping in the nearby forest.

Ten more heartbeats. "Bobby?" you call out in a hoarse whisper. Maybe he can't hear you, but you're too nervous to raise your voice. "Bobby? Are you up there?"

There is no answer.

## 10. Secret Door

**Event [arriving from the south, before the room description]:** 
Ducking your head to avoid the low ceiling, you follow the tunnel for some distance.

**Description:** 
The tunnel ends here at a blank, stone wall.

**Description when the secret door is open:** 
The wall at the north end of the tunnel has swung open, revealing a secret entrance to the castle.

**Event [when you first arrive at the Secret Door with Bobby]:** 
Bobby steps past you and brushes his fingertips across the stonework, holding the torch close. Eventually he finds a loose brick and pulls it free, revealing a rough, rectangular hole.

You wonder how many times Bobby has been down here. He exudes an easy confidence as he reaches into the hole, as though he has done this many times before.

There is a *click.* Bobby looks over his shoulder at you and winks. And then the wall swings away, revealing shadowed spaces beyond.

**Event [arriving here from the north, after listening at the Guardhouse, after room description]:** 
Bobby reaches back and pulls the secret door shut, carefully easing it the last few inches so that it doesn't slam. He puts the loose brick back in its place, just as before, and tugs his torch free of the bracket where he'd left it.

*We're out,* you realize with a sense of overwhelming relief. *We made it.* *It's like we were never here.*

"Some adventure, eh, Jack?" laughs Bobby. His voice is disturbingly loud after the long minutes of terrified silence in the keep. "Eavesdropping on the Lord's own guardsmen! That's a story that'll have the little ones wide-eyed at the Maiden House, eh?" He claps you on the back, and you manage a smile. It *was* fun, and you want Bobby to think you had fun, but it will be a while before you feel up to something that dangerous again.

**Command [closing the secret door]:** 
Better let Bobby handle the secret door. If you close it, you'll never figure out how to get it open again.

**Command [go north, or open the secret door after listening at the Guardhouse]:** 
You're more than ready to go home now, and you're not sure you could find the loose brick again in any case.
