## Design

### 1. Lord's Market

**Description:** Lord's Market is the kind of place that makes you immediately aware of your patched cloak and muddy boots. The storefronts here are built from imported marble and trimmed with ornate ironwork. The customers are decked out in lace and silk and furs, and accompanied by armed bodyguards or servants to carry their purchases. The clientele at Grubber's and Commerce Street treat you with tolerant indifference, for the most part, but one look from the aristocrats at Lord's Market makes you feel like dirt on their shoes.

**Event [first time entering Lord's Market]:** "Oi! Jack! Took you long enough!" Bobby appears at your elbow, his hair newly cut and a fresh bruise on his cheek. "Let's get out of sight before one of these hoity-toity ninnies calls the guards on us, yeah?"

### 2. NPC: Bobby

**Initial Appearance:** Bobby is here, his eyes scanning the crowd warily.

**Description:** Bobby is sixteen, lean and a bit rough around the edges, but there's an alertness to him that your other street friends lack. Today he seems especially on edge – his eyes keep darting to the rooftops and alleyways, and he keeps one hand near the knife at his belt.

**Command [greet/talk to Bobby]:** "About time you showed up," Bobby says. "We need to talk, but not here. Too many eyes. Follow me – I know a place where we can speak freely."

**Event [following Bobby]:** Bobby leads you through a series of back alleys and side streets you've never seen before. He moves like someone who's memorized every possible escape route in the city. Finally, you emerge on a quiet road leading north toward Lord's Keep.

### 3. Lord's Road

**Description:** The wide, paved road leads north from the city to Lord's Keep. Ancient oaks line both sides, their branches forming a green canopy overhead. The keep itself looms in the distance, its towers and battlements stark against the sky.

**NPC: Bobby (traveling companion)**

**Conversation during travel:**
- "You know those mercenaries looking for you?" Bobby says quietly. "They're not local muscle. Baron brought them in special from the borderlands. Mean bastards, every one."
- "Listen, Jack... there's something you need to know. About who you really are. About why they want you dead."
- "The Queen's coming to the Keep. Big announcement - the Baron's going to marry Princess Elizaveta. Once that happens, he'll be next in line for the throne."

### 4. Lord's Keep Approach

**Description:** The main gates of Lord's Keep are closed and heavily guarded. Bobby steers you away from the main entrance, following the wall to the east.

**Command [ask Bobby about alternate entrance]:** "Not going in the front door, if that's what you're thinking," Bobby says. "But there's another way. Through the Small Woods. Come on."

### 5. Small Woods

**Description:** The Small Woods press close against the eastern wall of Lord's Keep. The trees here are old and thick, their roots breaking through ancient cobblestones from some long-forgotten path.

**Object: Hidden Path**
- **Description:** What looks like an animal trail leads deeper into the woods.
- **Command [follow path]:** Bobby pushes aside some hanging vines to reveal an old door set into the wall, nearly invisible beneath centuries of ivy growth.

### 6. Secret Entrance

**Description:** The door is small and heavily weathered, with rusty iron hinges that probably haven't been oiled in decades.

**Object: Old Door**
- **Description:** An ancient wooden door, barely visible beneath the ivy.
- **Command [Bobby opens door]:** Bobby produces a key from somewhere and works it into the lock. It takes some effort, but finally the mechanism clicks. "Duke Toresal showed me this when I was younger," he says quietly. "Back when he trusted me with things."

### 7. Hidden Passage

**Description:** A narrow stone passage leads into darkness. The air is cold and damp, and you can hear the distant sound of voices echoing from somewhere above.

**Event [moving through passage]:** As you follow Bobby through the twisting passage, you begin to hear clearer sounds from above - servants preparing for some grand event. Bobby puts a finger to his lips and leads you to a small grating in the wall.

### 8. Listening Post

**Description:** Through the grating, you can see into what appears to be a servant's corridor. Two maids hurry past, their arms full of fresh linens.

**Overheard Dialogue:**
- "Her Majesty arrives tomorrow afternoon!"
- "And the ball is tomorrow night. The Baron's had us working day and night to prepare."
- "I heard he's planning to announce his betrothal to Princess Elizaveta."
- "Poor thing. Marrying that monster just to secure the succession."
- "Hush! You'll get us both flogged talking like that."

**Event [after overhearing]:** Bobby's face is grim. "Now you understand," he whispers. "Once the Baron marries into the royal family, he'll have a legitimate claim to the throne. And the first thing he'll do is eliminate any rival claims. Like yours."

**Command [ask Bobby "What do you mean, mine?"]:** Bobby looks at you with something like pity. "You really don't know, do you? Jack... your father was Duke William Toresal. You're his only living heir. That makes you the rightful ruler of these lands - and a threat to everything the Baron's planned."

### 9. Return Journey

**Description:** The journey back through the secret passage feels different now, weighted with the knowledge of your true identity.

**Bobby's Revelation:**
"I've been watching over you for years," Bobby admits. "On the Duke's orders at first, then... well, then because it was the right thing to do. The maidens at the Maiden House, they know too. They've been protecting you, preparing you."

"But now the Baron knows you exist. Someone talked. And he won't stop until you're dead."

"We need to get you back to the Maiden House. The women there will know what to do next."

**Event [exiting the woods]:** As you emerge from the Small Woods, Bobby suddenly tenses. "Damn. They've found us." In the distance, you can see a group of mercenaries heading your way. "Run, Jack. Get back to the city. I'll try to lead them off."

**Command [refuse to leave Bobby]:** "Don't be stupid!" Bobby shoves you toward the city. "You're more important than me. GO!"

[This leads to Chapter V - the attempted return through the city and capture]
