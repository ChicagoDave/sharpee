# Chapter IV - Lord's Market and Meeting Bobby

## 1. Lord's Market

**Description:** 
Lord's Market is the high-class mirror to Grubber's Market: a wide, cobbled square, uncrowded and clean, shaded by tall buildings on either side. Here Toresal's upper crust can hunt for bargains inaccessible to the ordinary rabble. Horses, carriages, antiques, custom jewelry, and similarly high-priced goods are available behind the discreet, tasteful shopfronts. You can return to Commerce Street to the west, and an alley leads south.

**Night Description:** 
At night, lanterns hung from ornate posts light the empty square of Lord's Market. Their warm yellow glow seems to make the shadows in the alleys that much darker.

### Scenery Object: Shopfronts
**Synonyms:** stores/shops/horses/carriages/antiques/jewelry/buildings

**Command [examining or entering the stores]:** 
All of these shops are far too exclusive -- and expensive -- to admit the likes of you.

**Command [examining or entering the stores at night]:** 
The shops are all locked for the night.

### NPC: People
**Description:** 
Most of the people wandering about Lord's Market are well dressed servants of the upper class (even for merchandise as nice as this, rich people rarely do their own shopping). Everyone looks to be in a dreadful hurry, with dreadfully important business to attend to, and no one affords you so much as a second glance.

**Command [talk to people]:** 
No one pays a scruffy urchin such as yourself any heed.

**Command [do anything to people]:** 
It's usually not a good idea to bother these people. They are quick to assume you're a pickpocket and yell for the City Guard.

## 2. Back Alley

**Description:** 
A little-known shortcut between Lord's Market and the less affluent neighborhoods of the city's south end. A narrow street to the southwest leads to Maiden House, or you can return to the market square to the north.

## NPC: Bobby

**Description:** 
Bobby is a few years older than you, a tall, broad-shouldered lad with touseled blonde hair and a rakish grin. He's an orphan, like you, and like you he makes the streets of the city his home and lives by his wits. Unlike you, he doesn't have the safety net of Maiden House to fall back on, but somehow he always seems to do well for himself.

You also happen to think that he's devastatingly handsome, although you would never admit that under the worst torture the King's interrogators could devise. He doesn't even know that you're really a girl, and you're not about to tell him, because if he knew he would certainly stop inviting you along on his exploits.

### First Meeting Scene

**Initial Appearance [the first time you enter the Alley and see Bobby]:** 
At the end of the alley, a group of young urchins -- none older than their eighth year -- are clustered around something. As you draw closer, you see Bobby crouched in the midst of them. He's holding his arm out, his fist loosely clenched in front of a dirty-cheeked child of six.

"Go on," says Bobby. "Go on, take a look."

The little boy, his eyes wide and solid, reaches out and pries Bobby's fingers open. His hand is empty. The little boy looks dismayed.

"Ah, but what's this?" asks Bobby. And he reaches forward and draws a copper coin from behind the boy's grimy ear. A collective gasp, then squeals of delight from the rest of the children, and the little boy's eyes look ready to fall out of his head.

Bobby presses the coin into the little boy's hand, then passes out more coins to the others. "Here," he says, "keep it safe in your pocket. Spend it on bread, not candy." The children take their prizes and scatter.

Bobby stands and stretches, then he sees you. The corner of his mouth goes up in that lop-sided grin you know so well. "'Lo, Jack," he says. "What's happening?"

**Initial Appearance [in the alley, after the first time]:** 
Jack leans carelessly against the alley wall, watching you with a slight, wry smile.

### The Invitation

**Event [after you've spent three turns in Bobby's presence]:** 
"Hey listen," says Bobby, "So I've been looking for you, right? I found this new place, big secret, extra tricky. I was thinking of doing a bit of exploring there later tonight. You want to come with?" He smiles that knowing half-smile of his, the one that always means he's about to suggest something that will be very fun, or land you both in a pile of trouble, or -- the usual case -- both.

What, you're going to say no? Heart thumping a bit harder than you'd like it to, you give an enthusiastic nod.

"Good fellow," says Bobby. "Now, you don't want the Maidens worrying about you, so head on home for now. Once it gets dark, sneak back out and meet me in the Grubber's Market. Right? Good. See you later, Jack." He claps his hand on your shoulder, then turns and strides all grace and overconfidence, out of the alley.

### Idle Behavior [while in the Alley, first encounter]:
- Bobby whistles a few notes of some popular mummer's tune.
- Bobby smirks at you in that way he has, that makes you want to smile and blush and run and hide, all at the same time.
- You realize you're staring, and quickly find something else to look at. Goddesses, but he's handsome.
- Bobby rakes his fingers back through his tangled hair.

### Bobby Conversation Table

| Subject | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Me | Bobby very carefully walks a fine line of treating you like a guy friend, but also not offending you because he knows you're a girl and he also knows you have a bit of a crush on him. |
