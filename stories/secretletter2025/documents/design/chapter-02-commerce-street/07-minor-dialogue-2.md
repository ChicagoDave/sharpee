# Chapter II - Olgan Minor Dialogue Part 2

## Conversation Table (Olgan Minor) - Part 2

| Subject | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Inheritance (before he knows who you are) | "There is no inheritance, boy. The old Duke Toresal had no heir; his estate will be absorbed by the crown." |
| Inheritance (after he knows who you are) | Minor grins in an unpleasant way. "Careful who you talk to about that, girl," he says. "Not that you've a bloody chance of being recognized, but there's some who'd see your claim as a threat. There's some who'd like to see someone like you disappear, and plenty who'd be willing to make it happen." |
| Ascension | "The crown should go to whomever is strong enough to take it," says Minor. "These ascension games are a waste of time." |
| Toresal | Minor snorts. "This town thinks itself so bloody important, but it's never been more than a provincial trading post where the rich dress themselves up to look sophisticated." |
| Kingdom | "Taxes are high, people are lazy, women scorn their husbands and walk the streets dressed as tramps." Minor spits. "The kingdom is in poor shape, I'd say." |
| Taxes | "Sanctioned thievery," snaps Minor, "corruption at its worst." |
| Clans | Minor smiles; it is not a pleasant sight. "I'm originally from the Su' Hart Klan, over the mountains and far to the west. I may yet return, someday." |
| Sea | "I've sailed the Eastern Sea, boy," Minor says with a mysterious smile. "I did many things before learning the craft of weapons." |
| Small Woods | "More extravagance. The Lord stages his pretty hunts on land that could be put to better used." |
| Mermaid Fountain | "Useless and pretty; now it's broken and decayed." Minor smirks. "Just like everything else from the old Lord's rule." |
| Secret Passage (before he knows who you are) | Minor's eyes narrow, but he says nothing. |
| Secret Passage (after he knows who you are, first time) | Minor smiles a thin, deadly smile. He is idly twirling his little knife with one hand, but you don't remember seeing him draw it from anywhere. "That's a very dangerous bit of information you know there, young lady," he says quietly. "Not the kind of thing you'd want to let just anyone know that *you* know about it, if you take my meaning." |
| Secret Passage (after he knows who you are, subsequent times) | He says nothing, just continues to stare at you and smile. |
