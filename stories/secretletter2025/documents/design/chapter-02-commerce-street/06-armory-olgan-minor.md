# Chapter II - The Armory and Olgan Minor

## 4. Armory

**Description:** 
The tangy smell of oiled steel is nearly overpowering in this small, windowless shop. All of the really interesting weapons -- axes, flails, spiked gauntlets and the like -- are high up on racks on the back wall, well behind the high counter. However, there is a display of assorted knives and daggers sitting out where you can get a close look at them.

### Object: Dagger Display
**Description:** 
Over a dozen gleaming blades neatly lined up on a rectangle of dark green velvet; from long, wicked stilettos, to demure little stickers you could hide inside an opera glove, to gigantic cleavers that would make Holstenoffer next door jealous.

**Command [buying a dagger]:** 
Pieter leans over your shoulder as you inspect the daggers. "Having the right weapon is as important as knowing what to do with it," he tells you. "You don't want big or fancy; you want something sharp, long enough to do damage to a man when you stick him with it, but slim enough to hide under your, er..." he suddenly blushes and clears his throat. "Anyway. That one," he says, pointing to a plain-handled blade about six inches long. "That's the one you want."

Olgan Minor grumbles, but Pieter glares at him again and suggests that if your gold is no good here, then perhaps some other metal might suit the shopkeeper better. Grudgingly, Minor hands over the knife and sheath, and makes a show of biting your gold coin to make sure of its worth.

### Object: Interesting Weapons/Axes/Flails/Gauntlets
**Description:** 
The sheer variety of ways to grievously injure someone with a sharp, metal instrument leaves you both impressed and vaguely disturbed.

**Command [doing anything to the weapons]:** 
The big weapons are all behind the counter, high out of reach.

**Command [buying one of the big weapons]:** 
Pieter shakes his head. "Those sorts of weapons are too big to wear discreetly," he tells you, "and most are too heavy for you to lift in any case."

**Event [buying anything without money]:** 
Minor barks an unpleasant laugh. "Run along, *girl*, before you cut yourself."

## NPC: Armory Shopkeeper (Olgan Minor)

**Initial Appearance:** 
Olgan Minor, the proprietor, leans against the counter, watching you intently.

**Description:** 
Olgan Minor is short but muscular, with a lined face and graying, military-cut hair. He says nothing as you browse his wares, but his eyes seem to bore right into you. You are suddenly certain that he knows you're not really a boy -- that he knew it the instant you walked into his shop.

[first time only] You've heard that Olgan Minor is not one to trifle with -- and now that you've seen him, you believe it.

### Idle Behavior
[1 in 5 chance each turn, pick randomly]
- Minor's eyes seem to drill right into you.
- Minor takes a small knife from his sleeve and starts trimming his nails. The whole time, he never stops staring at you. He never blinks.
- Minor's constant staring is really starting to creep you out. You find yourself wishing you'd never entered his shop.

## Conversation Table (Olgan Minor) - Part 1

| Subject | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Me | Minor's eyes drill into yours. "And why exactly should I be interested in you, boy?" |
| Mercenaries | Minor smirks. "Those are some of my best customers you're disparaging, boy. I'd try to be more respectful, if I were you." |
| Bobby | "I know the lad," he says, and then falls silent. |
| Father | "Never met him," Minor says, "but I wouldn't think much of him just by looking at you, boy." |
| Maidens | "Bloody charity." He fairly spits the word. "Those mother hens should be married off, and their charges put to work." |
| Teisha | "Should I know every doxy, beggar, and trinket-seller in the city? You take me for some chirping marketstall gossip, boy?" |
| Maiden House | "That building used to be a hotel for travelers," says Minor. "Now it's a bloody waste of taxpayers' coin." |
| Fossville | "What's it to you what I think of the Baron, boy?" he sneers. "He's a bloody sight better than the old Lord, at any rate. Make a fine King as well, maybe." |
| Black Gate Estate | "Never been there." |
| Red Gate Estate | "More waste," spits Minor. "That house should be sold. The old Lord has been dead long enough." |
| Jacob's Mansion | Minor shrugs. "A fine mansion. What of it?" |
| Jacobs | "They're an... interesting clan," Minor says, but then says no more. |
| Commerce Street | "What of it? It's a place to sell goods. I'd be grateful for better-smelling neighbors," he adds, with a contemptuous glare towards the butcher shop, "but otherwise I can't complain." |
| Grubber's Market | He shrugs. "I do trade with a man there sometimes; he's a good customer and gives a good bargain in return." |
| Lord's Market | "Useless dandies and spoiled women buying overpriced trinkets," Minor sneers. |
| Lord's Keep | "A keep is meant for fortification, not displays of frivolous excess. Hopefully the Baron will make better use of the place than the old Lord did." |
| Ball (before ball is announced) | "I've no use for such affairs." |
| Ball (after ball is announced) | "I've heard that Fossville will likely announce his engagement to the Queen's daughter, so perhaps there will be some point to the ceremony after all." |
| Queen | "Bloody useless woman," he mutters. "The old King was as poor a judge of character as he was a tactician." |
| Princess | Minor's lip curls in what might be a smile. "They say she's a temperamental woman, but a resourceful one." |
| Spies | Minor chuckles. "Aye, boy... you never know who might be listening in on your conversations or your nosey questions, do you?" |
| Jail | Minor narrows his eyes in a way that makes you want to take a step or two back. "Never been," he growls. |
| Food | "I'm no grocer, boy," says Minor. |
| Sewers | "More wasted tax dollars," he sniffs. "A man does just as well with a chamber pot and the occasional rain." |
