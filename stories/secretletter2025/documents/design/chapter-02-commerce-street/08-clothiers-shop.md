# Chapter II - The Clothier's Shop

## 5. Clothier's (Royal Tunic)

**Description:** 
The walls are hung with tasteful curtains, and a deep, soft carpet covers the floor. Several clothier's dummies stand about the room, displaying gorgeous formal court apparel for both men and women. The street lies north.

### Object: Dummies
**Description:** 
Armless, headless torsos carved from wood, stuck atop iron tripods, and dressed in fancy clothes. They're actually a bit ghoulish, now that you really look at them.

**Command [doing anything to the dummies]:** 
Since there's nothing here you could afford to buy, and nothing you could easily steal, you make an effort to keep your hands to yourself.

### Object: Clothes
**Description:** 
The clothes here are lovely -- rich velvets and flowing silks, dyed with brilliant colors and embroidered with lace and gems. [first time only]These are the sorts of costumes that you imagine while lying on your straw mattress back at Maiden House, dreaming about dazzling the Prince at the Royal Ball. Stupid fantasies, you know, but oh -- if you could only wear something as beautiful as these, just for one evening...

[if you have not bathed]Suddenly, you remember that you're supposed to be looking at the *men's* clothing. You glance nervously at the shopkeeper, but he doesn't seem to find your intense interest in ladies' formal wear strange in the slightest.

### Shopping for the Ball Gown

**Command [buying clothes if you haven't bathed]:** 
The clothier is not likely to sell anything to a dirty urchin such as yourself. Besides, you're only interested in the dresses, and it would raise awkward questions if you asked him to sell you one.

**Command [buying clothes if you haven't any money]:** 
You point to one of the dresses, and the clothier quotes you a price that leaves you feeling distinctly queasy. Of course, your old wardrobe consists entirely of cast-offs from the older orphans and whatever interesting bits you were able to scrounge from back-alley trash bins. Who knew *real* clothes cost so much?

"You need to listen to Mrs. Sandler, kid," remarks Pieter. "Get yourself some money first."

**Command [buying the dress when you do have money]:** 
After several agonizing minutes of indecision, you point to the dress you want.

The clothier flutters his hands and practically giggles, "Oh, a *splendid* choice! You'll look like a princess!" He dances around you, taking measurements with his cord and muttering numbers to himself as he goes. Then he takes the dress off its dummy and retreats with it into the back of his shop. "This will be *just* a moment," he calls over his shoulder.

You look at Pieter and shrug.

"Er, I'll wait outside," he says.

And afterwards, as you look at yourself in the full-length mirror while the clothier kneels at your feet, tugging, plucking, pinning, making adjustments, you realize that he was right -- you *do* look like a princess.

[remove dress, now the player is wearing the ball gown]

### Object: Ball Gown
**Description:** 
The dress is pale blue with tiny pearls embroidered into the bodice and dagged sleeves.

**Event [after you exit the Clothier's shop while wearing the dress, after printing the room description]:** 
Pieter blinks and does a double take as you step out onto the sidewalk in your new finery. "*Wow*," he stammers. "You look... different. I mean, you looked good before, er, with the other dress, I mean, but this is... *wow*." He blushes, then grins, then shakes his head. "Come on, Lady Toresal. We still have much to do."

## NPC: Clothier Shopkeeper

### First Entry Events

**Event [when you first enter the shop]:** 
A small bell above the door tinkles as you enter, and a man comes rushing out of the store's back room with a measuring cord in his hands, held up as though ready to begin fitting you immediately. When he sees that you're merely a boy (and by all appearances, not one with much in the way of discretionary income at that), he stops in his tracks and his expression grows distinctly pouty. He manages to keep most of the disappointment out of his voice as he asks, "May I *help* you?"

**Event [when you first enter the shop after having bathed]:** 
A small bell above the door tinkles as you enter, and a man comes rushing out of the store's back room with a measuring cord in his hands, held up as though ready to begin fitting you immediately. When he sees that you are a clean, respectable, and evidently well-to-do young lady, he practically squeals with delight, clapping his hands and plucking at the fabric of your clothes with soft, nimble fingers.

### Description and Appearance

**Initial Appearance [before bath]:** 
The clothier stands nearby, eyeing you with some distaste.

**Initial Appearance [after bath]:** 
The clothier hovers nearby, waiting to serve.

**Description:** 
Tall, thin, and impeccably dressed, although his fashion sense seems a bit...decorative, compared to the more austere look preferred by men of Toresal's upper class. His hairline is receding, and what hair he has left is plastered back onto his scalp with fragrant oil. He look as though he'd secretly prefer to wipe things down with a scented handkerchief before touching them; somehow, through good breeding and intestinal fortitude, he manages to soldier on despite not doing so.
