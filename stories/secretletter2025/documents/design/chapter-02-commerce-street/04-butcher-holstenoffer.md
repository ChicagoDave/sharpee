# Chapter II - The Butcher Shop and Holstenoffer

## 3. Butcher's Shop

**Description:** 
Chains of linked sausages and thick, red cuts of meat dangle from hooks in the ceiling, and trays of less identifiable and less pleasant-looking bits sit out on the counters. It's better than some butcheries you've seen, but it's still not your favorite place in the city. You can leave to the south.

### Object: Meat/Sausages/Trays/Bits
- **Description:** The sausage looks tasty enough, and the hanging meat cuts would probably look good once they're cooked. The rest of it just makes you sort of ill.
- **Command [eat, taste, or smell the meat]:** For some reason, this place just kills your appetite.

### Object: Chopping Block
- **Description:** Holstenoffer's chopping block is cut from a single, gigantic piece of unstained oak. Its surface is stained black with blood, soaked three inches down into the wood's grain.
- **Command [doing anything to the chopping block]:** The chopping block is behind the counter, out of your reach -- and honestly, you prefer it that way.

## NPC: Butcher (Old Man Holstenoffer)

**Initial Appearance:** 
Old Man Holstenoffer is leaning over his huge, bloodstained butcher block behind the counter, hacking up some carcass.

**Description:** 
Holstenoffer is a squat brick of a man, with a scarred bulldog's face and sailors' tattoos covering his arms from the wrists all the way up to his rolled-up sleeves. He's friendly enough, but he has a tendency to gesticulate with his cleaver in hand, which sometimes makes conversation with him a tense and athletic affair.

### Object: Cleaver (carried by Holstenoffer)
**Description:** 
Holstenoffer calls his cleaver "Big Molly," and often talks to it as though it were a pet. The side of the blade is tarnished and dull from years of use, but the edge is so sharp enough that hacking through through thick muscle and bone is no more difficult than cutting pudding.

### Initial Dialogue
**Event [when player first enters the shop]:** 
He glances over his shoulder as you come in. "Ey, Jack!" he calls. "Long time, no see. Bobby was around this morning, looking for yeh. Up to something again, eh?" he laughs.

### Idle Behavior 
[1 in 5 chance each turn, picked at random]
- Holstenoffer's cleaver cuts through a particularly tough joint with a gristly, crunching sound.
- Holstenoffer chops deftly at the raw meat on his block, cutting into narrow strips.
- Holstenoffer stops to wipe his hands on his blood-smeared apron.
- Holstenoffer stops suddenly and holds up a slippery-looking chunk of red gristle. "Huh," he mutters, "never seen one of *those* before." With a shrug, he tosses it into a tray labeled "Bargain Bits".
- Holstenoffer glances at you over his shoulder. "Not that I mind yer company, Jack," he says, "but maybe yeh should go find Bobby."

## Conversation Table (Holstenoffer) - Part 1

| Subject | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Me | "Looking healthy as ever, Jack. Why, somebody botherin yeh? You send em over to meet me an Big Molly, here," he says, waving his cleaver. "We can take care of it for yeh." |
| Mercenaries | Holstenoffer's squinty eyes narrow even further when you tell him about the mercenaries scouring Grubber's Market. "Filthy mercs," he growls. "Let em try coming up here...they'll find more than some timid stall merchant!" He shakes his cleaver to emphasize the point, forcing you to take a quick step backwards to avoid a deep facial scar. |
| Bobby | "He said something about waiting for you over by Lord's Market somewhere." Holstenoffer waves his cleaver vaguely eastward, flinging a bit of gristle across the room. "Yeh know, yeh oughtta stick around Bobby more, Jack. He's a big, strong lad. Teach a skinny boy like yeh to take better care of yehself, eh?" |
| Teisha | "The silk merchant? She's a pretty one. Mention her to the doughboy next door, and yeh'll see more'n his bread rising, if yeh know what I mean." |
| Father | Holstenoffer gives you a queer look. "Whaddayeh askin me for, Jack? I dunno nothin about yer past." |
| Mother | He shrugs. "I heard she was an unlucky soul. Dunno what else I could tell yeh, Jack." |
| Maidens | "Ah, the lovely ladies." Holstenoffer smiles. "Been eyein the plump one meself... what's her name again? It's about time I took in a wife, and ol' Holstenoffer ain't too picky, if yeh know what I mean." |
| Maiden House | "A fine place, it is," he says. "Keeps yeh urchins out of trouble... mostly. That's what's important." |
| Fossville (first time) | Holstenoffer's cleaver *whacks* into the carving board, and he turns to glare at you, red-faced. "Dammit, Jack, I told yeh, don't be sayin that name in my shop. Makes me so angry, I'm like to cut a man's hand off. The Baron's a rat and I'll not be afraid to say it. He don't care about this city. He don't care about nothin' but his own purse and his own power." He leans closer to you. "Yeh ask me, him an the old Lord was at odds, back in the day. Methinks the Baron won that battle, though, an not by playin fair." |
| Fossville (subsequent times) | Holstenoffer shakes his cleaver at you. "I said I don't wanna be talkin about it, Jack. The Baron's no good." |
| Black Gate Estate | "Ah yeah, that's a pretty house the Baron has there," scoffs the butcher. "Would yeh like some tea?" he squeaks in a mocking falsetto, twirling his cleaver. "Or maybe some crumpets? Ha! Old Baron Fussypants likes his fancy things, that's for damn sure." |
| Red Gate Estate | "That place has been collectin dust since the old Lord's death, may the Goddesses carry his soul. No one's taken up the place, not even the Baron -- though yeh'd think he'd be interested just so as to tear it down and build a new wing for his own place. Ah, there's been rumors about an heir, coming back to claim the place, but I have my doubts. They say the old Lord never had much luck siring a son with that old battleaxe the Queen forced him to marry." |
| Jacob's Mansion | Holstenoffer grunts, swishing his cleaver dismissively. "Don't know much about that house, and glad of it. The Jacobs're all thieves, always have been. Nothin but trouble that way." |
| Jacobs | "I try to stay out of his way," he admits. "Not that I'd have much trouble with one or two of 'em givin me trouble. But there's a whole family of 'em, yeh know. Best to not get on his bad side." |
| Commerce Street | He smiles. "Ah, I do love it here. I came from farm country, yeh know, before me days on the seas, and I couldn't get out fast enough. But choppin' chicken necks was something I always had a knack for, and this is as good a place as any to practice a trade." |
| Grubber's Market | "Some of the shopkeepers around here turn their nose up at Grubber's," says Holstenoffer. "Not me. Get me cleavers special made there, and me leather aprons too. Soaks up blood better than any cloth, and at a bargain, too." |
| Lord's Market | "Pah!" He waggles his cleaver with a fluorish of contempt. "Yeh wouldn't catch me over there for a sweet calf and ten fat hens. Not me kind of place at all. Course yer pal Bobby's over there all the time. Likes to oggle the high-class ladies, I guess. 'Smatter, Jack, need some air?" You turn away before Holstenoffer can see you blushing. |
| Lord's Keep | "Never been there meself," says Holstenoffer. "Would that a better soul were occupying it now. That Baron is likely to foul the place with his stink." |
