## Chapter Summary
Jack has escaped to Commerce Street and has opportunities to gather information from various merchants about the world, the political situation, and recent events. This is primarily an information-gathering chapter where the player learns about the wider context of their situation.

## Rundown

Jack has opportunities to talk to people about the environment:
- Baker (Germaise)
- Butcher (Old man Holstenoffer)
- Armory (Olgan Minor)
- Clothier
- Jeweler (Mrs. Sandler, with guards Pieter and Rudolph)
- Moneylender (Chorus Brothers)

## Notes

- There isn't much to this scene other than gathering information
- The player can end the scene at anytime by going to find Bobby
- Each merchant has a distinct personality and different information to share
- Some merchants are more sympathetic to Jack than others
- Information learned here will be important for later chapters

## Key Mechanics

1. **Dialogue System**: Extensive conversation trees with each merchant
2. **Information Gathering**: Learning about politics, characters, and locations
3. **Character Building**: Establishing relationships that will matter later
4. **Day/Night Cycle**: Shops close at night
