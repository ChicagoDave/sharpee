# Chapter II - The Jeweler (Sandler and Sons)

## 6. Jeweler (Sandler and Sons)

**Description:** 
The inside of this store is tasteful but austerely decorated, perhaps to better draw the eye towards the glass display cases in the center of the room, and the king's ransom in jewelry contained therein. You can leave to the north.

### Object: Display Cases
**Description:** 
There are four glass-topped cases, each sitting on a carved wooden pedestal. Light from hanging candelabras glitters across the diamond-encrusted rings, bracelets, pendants, brooches, and necklaces spread out on black velvet.

**Command [open cases]:** 
The cases are locked, of course. And Pieter and Rudolph have their eyes on you constantly.

#### Object: Jewelry
**Description:** 
Any one piece is several times more valuable than everything you've ever nicked in your entire life, put together. The thought of wearing something that extravagant on your wrist makes your skin tingle.

## NPCs: The Guards

### The two guards (collectively)
**Initial Appearance:** 
Two guards stand discreetly near the back of the room.

**Description:** 
Rudolph and Pieter are good fellows. You've traded friendly words with them in the past, but most of the time they stay quiet to preserve a sense of professionalism. Rudolph gives you a slight smile and nod when you catch his eye.

### NPC: Rudolph
**Description:** 
Rudolph is the smarter of the two, and tends to treat you more like an adult.

### NPC: Pieter
**Description:** 
Pieter is a bit dim, but loyal to Dame Sandler and tirelessly vigilant. He's nice enough, but he tends to think you're about eight years old, and speaks to you accordingly.

## NPC: Mrs. Sandler

**Initial Appearance:** 
Dame Sandler stands near the central display case. A small, dignified smile plays on her lips.

### First Entry Event
**Event [when you first enter the jewelry shop]:** 
Dame Sandler is here as usual. Her eyebrows raise slightly as you walk into her store. "Well, hello there, Sire Jack," she says, in her typically smooth (and the slightest bit mocking) tone. "We haven't had the pleasure of your company in a while. You look a bit out of breath -- nothing ails you, I hope?"

**Description:** 
Though in her elder years, Dame Sandler is still a tall and striking woman. Her long, silver hair is pulled back in a complicated bun, and she has a habit of inspecting her merchandise through a monocle on the end of a long, slender, gold-filigreed handle. Sometimes you wonder what she's doing running a shop (even such a relatively high-class one as this); her demeanor is more that of an aristocrat, if not full royalty.

Although you almost never come to her shop (everything in here is too expensive to buy and too well-guarded to nick), for some reason Dame Sandler has always taken a liking to you, and never runs you out when you visit, even when she important customers to tend to. It's more of a bemused curiosity than real affection, but feels good to be on a friendly basis with such an intriguing woman.

### After Bath Events

**Event [when you first enter the jewelry shop, after having a bath]:** 
Dame Sandler looks you over and smiles. She does not seem at all surprised by your change in dress.

"Lady Jacqueline," she says, inclining her head, "how nice to see you finally looking yourself, after all these years. Come, child, let me get a look at you." She takes your chin gently between two fingers and tilts your face back and forth. "Hmm. You've simply destroyed your hair, of course, but there's nothing to be done now. It will grow out eventually."

She catches your eye then, and laughs. "Oh, child, did you think I didn't know? More people have had their eye on you than you realize. We've been waiting for the Duke's daughter to finally make herself known, and now here you are."

**Command [trying to leave the shop while the following monologue is taking place]:** 
Dame Sandler takes your elbow, gently but firmly. "Please don't go yet, dear; what I have to tell you is dreadfully important."

### The Revelation Sequence

**Event [one turn after entering the jewelry shop, after having a bath]:** 
Her expression turns serious. "What you must realize, Jacqueline, is that you represent a threat to certain people with ambitions toward the throne. Oh, yes," she says, seeing your incredulous expression, "even though your birth was illegitimate, you have a credible claim. The laws of ascension in our land are clear: in the absence of a clear blood successor, the ruler is determined by the will of the common people.

"The Duke was *very* popular with the common people. Baron Fossville...is not."

**Event [second turn after entering the jewelry shop, after having a bath]:** 
"The other thing you should realize is that there are *also* a number of people who are interested in seeing you succeed. Some of them may believe that you are the better candidate; more of them simply with to spite Fossville; *all* of them will expect you to be appropriately grateful for their aid should you actually succeed.

"But before you can enlist their aid," says Dame Sandler, "you must let it be known that you are in the game, and that you are a player worth backing. You must announce yourself. And to do that, you must attend Fossville's ball tonight."

You can barely catch your breath to respond. *You?* Attend a *royal ball?* This is all happening so fast...

Her voice softens a bit, and she puts a hand on your arm. "I realize this is a bit sudden and frightening, my dear, but you must accept it and act quickly. This will not simply go away; Fossville does not care whether you *want* the ascension; he will hunt you down regardless. So why not take him head-on? This is who you are, now. Enjoy it, play it to the hilt."

**Event [third turn after entering the jewelry shop, after having a bath]:** 
"Of course, you cannot attend the ball looking like this," she says, her tone becoming brisk and businesslike again. "You will need a dress, some jewelry...and a weapon. It is unlikely that Fossville would try to kill you in front of a hundred guests, but you can never be too careful. This will require money, of course, but now that you have proof of your heritage, the Chorus Brothers should be willing to help you in that area.

"And just to reassure you of my own good intentions..." Dame Sandler unlocks the display case with a tiny silver key and lifts up the lid. She gestures to the sparkling jewels within. "This will get you started. Take any one you like, child. I'm one of those who would see you succeed; this is my gift to you."

**Event [after taking the jewel]:** 
"A fine choice," says Dame Sandler. "Now hurry -- Fossville's ball is tonight, and there's not much time left. See the moneylenders first, then get a suitable dress and a discreet blade. Pieter will go with you---"

Pieter blinks. "What, to the ball?" he asks.

"Yes, Pieter," Sandler says pointedly, "to the ball. Just do what you always do -- keep your mouth shut and make sure no one harms the valuables, and you should be fine."

She turns back to you and smiles. "On your way, now. And good luck, Lady Jacqueline."
