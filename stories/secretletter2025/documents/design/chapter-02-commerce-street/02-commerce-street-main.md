# Chapter II - Commerce Street Main

## Scene Beginning

**Event [first turn after Jack enters Commerce Street, before the room description]:** 
You let out a long, shaky breath. You're safe now. Commerce Street is home to a slightly more upscale class of merchant, and business here is not quite as frantic as in Grubber's Market. Transactions tend to be calmer, more deliberate, and involve significantly more money. The Lord's Guard will be far less tolerant of a pack of armed bullies menacing the citizens of the upper class, so it's unlikely that the mercenaries will follow you here. And even if they did, there are too many streets and side alleys for them to block off your escape.

Now it's time to pause, catch your breath, and try to figure out why they were after you in the first place.

## 1. Commerce Street

**Description:** 
Commerce Street runs from Grubber's Market, to the west, to Lord's Market to the east. Raised sidewalks allow pedestrians to avoid the mud, horse dung, and occasional teamster's cart rumbling by. The shops here are actual buildings, spaced evenly along the avenue. Storefronts for a bakery, a butcher's shop, and an armory line the north side of the street from west to east; they are faced on the opposite side by a clothier, a jeweler, and a moneylender, respectively.

**Event [entering this street for the first time after acquiring jewel, gown, and dagger]:** 
Evening is falling over the city, and the streets are clearing of people. The ball at Lord's Keep will be starting soon -- you'd better hurry!

[switch to night description]

**Description, Night Scenes:** 
Commerce Street at night is eerily quiet and empty. Your footsteps seem echo on the cobbles as you walk past the shuttered shopfronts.

**Command [entering or examining a shop during a night scene]:** 
All of the shops are shuttered and locked up for the night.

## Storefronts (Scenery)

### Outside of Bakery
**Description:** 
A hanging sign above the door depicts a loaf of bread, and the warm smell of fried dough wafts out from the open door, making your stomach rumble.

Squeezed in between the bakery and the butcher's shop next door is the entrance to a tiny alleyway.

### Outside of Butcher's
**Description:** 
A brightly painted pig decorates the sign over this shop. The smell of burned sausage masks the darker odor of butchered animals.

Squeezed in between the butcher's shop and the bakery next door is the entrance to a tiny alleyway.

### Outside of Armory
**Description:** 
The walls over this shop are built of heavy, blackened bricks -- a grim exterior to house grim business. The sign over the door is painted with an axe and shield.

### Outside of Clothier
**Description:** 
A large window, trimmed in fine, dark wood, lets light into the front of the shop. A clothier's dummy dressed in a smartly cut tunic stands in front of a velvet backdrop, advertising the latest fashion to be found inside.

### Outside of Jeweler
**Description:** 
The sign above this store is painted with a necklace of pearls. The windows are blocked with thick (but decorative) iron bars, and the door sports a heavy lock. An engraved brass plaque reads "Sandler and Son."

### Outside of Moneylender
**Description:** 
A discreet placard next to the door reads "Chorus Brothers." The remainder of the windowless storefront is painted blue.

## Movement Restrictions

**Command [going west from Commerce Street]:** 
It would be a good idea to lay low for a while before returning to Grubber's Market.

**Command [entering any of the stores or going east from Commerce Street while still dressed as a girl]:** 
You'd better take off your "disguise" first -- most of the merchants on this street know you as Jack, and would be very confused to see you dressed as a girl.

## Object: Tiny Alleyway

**Description:** 
Almost more of a gutter than an proper alley, barely big enough for you to fit your shoulders through.

**Command [entering an alley]:** 
By sucking in your gut and turning sideways a bit, you manage to squeeze in between the two buildings.

## Baron Fossville Encounter

**Event [first turn after entering Commerce Street, after room description]:** 
As you are standing there getting your bearings, the door to the moneylender's shop suddenly slams open. A tall, dark-cloaked figure storms out, shouting over his shoulder, "...regret refusing my business! I know import---*OOF!*" ---and before you have a chance to react, he crashes into you. You both hit the cobbles in a tangle of limbs.

Muttering apologies, you try to disentangle yourself, but the man is on his feet in an instant, dragging you up by your elbow. "Why you insolent little cutpurse---"

A woman standing next to him places her hand on his shoulder. "Calm yourself, Fossville," she says. Only her chin and a few curls of long, golden hair are visible beneath the shadow of her hood, but the woman's voice is cool and commanding. "She's only a foolish little girl. You've already terrified her."

The man -- you realize now that he must be Baron Fossville, Lord of the city since the old Duke died, and one of the most powerful nobles in Toresal -- eyes you suspiciously. Even flustered, his sharp features are intense, handsome, and dangerously intelligent. His lips twitch slightly beneath his trim moustache. Finally, he releases you.

"Off with you then, urchin," he growls, flicking his fingers as though he had just touched something filthy. "Sell your paper flowers elsewhere, and learn to stay out from under the feet of your betters."

Fossville strides off towards Lord's Market, followed closely by his hooded companion. As she brushes past you, you can hear her talking in a low voice, "...have the money you need, but we must be subtle about it. The Queen can not appear to play favorites..."

And then they are gone.
