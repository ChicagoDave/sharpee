# Chapter II - Holstenoffer Dialogue Part 2

## Conversation Table (Holstenoffer) - Part 2

| Subject | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Ball (before announcement) | "A ball, eh? Haven't had a ball up at the Keep in ages. Not since the old Lord..." he trails off, and turns back to his chopping with a grim vigor. |
| Ball (after announcement) | He looks bashful. "Eh, well, about that... I got a big order came in this morning. From the Baron, paid up front. Makes me sick, it does, but business is business, yeh know? A man has to eat." |
| Queen | Holstenoffer's cleaver flashes as his chopping gets faster and angrier. "That daft old bat can't rule so much as her own temper. What a sorry mess we'll all be in when she croaks." |
| Princess (before announcement, first time) | "Goddesses preserve yeh, Jack!", he yells, and throws a handful of salt on the floor. "That creature's worse than her mum! I'm not superstitious by nature, but I'd rather not suffer under *her* reign any sooner than I have to, so let's not push our luck, eh?" |
| Princess (before announcement, subsequent times) | Holstenoffer cuts you off, pointing his cleaver at you menacingly. "I warned yeh, Jack. Don't speak of her here." |
| Princess (after announcement) | His shoulders slump. "We're doomed, Jack," he says, his cleaver dangling from limp fingers. "Yeh know what they're sayin, don't yeh? The Baron plans to court the Princess at this ball; he'll maneuver for the crown, next, and then that scoundrel's got the whole kingdom in his grubby paws. We're doomed, I'm tellin yeh." |
| Spies (before Bobby's death) | "Well," he muses, "The King had quite the network of informers, or so I hear. But that was more than ten years ago. I doubt they're still around." He thinks for a moment. "But if they are... who'd they loyal too, yeh think? The Queen? That wouldn't bode well for anyone." |
| Spies (after Bobby's death) | "I *knew* there was somethin funny about that Bobby," says Holstenoffer, shaking his head. "I guess he had us all fooled, and good." |
| Jail | "Well," he says, sheepishly, "I been in a couple of times, only for bein drunk. It's not so bad. Most fellas in there know me and Big Molly here," he brandishes his cleaver, "so they leaves me alone. You know, Jack," he adds, "a good woman'd keep me out of the taverns, so she would. Put in a good word for me with the Maidens, and I'd consider it a kindness." |
| Rooftops | "Been up there once to patch the leaky roof, but I don't much care for heights," Holstenoffer says. "Word is, though, some of these old buildings are so close together, yeh can jump right across, go whole city blocks without touching the street. Bobby once told me, he hopped over to the Baron's rooftop garden and had himself a sandwich! Ha! Braver lad than me." |
| Food | "Ain't got nothin' cooked, but if yeh want scraps for stew back at the maiden house, I'm sure I can come up with something. Make sure yeh let the ladies know where you got it though, eh?" |
| Sewers | "Another of Duke Toresal's little improvements. Those tunnels are a blessing to this city, yeh know. I'd be paying a fortune to have me garbage hauled away if it weren't for the sewers." |
| Inheritance (before he knows who you really are) | Holstenoffer scowls, but with a sad kindness, "Jack," he says, "yeh're just an orphan. No tellin who yer mum hooked up with, and chances are yeh're better off no knowin. You're a lucky boy, Jack. Don't jinx it wishin for somethin' that's just a dream." |
| Inheritance (after he knows who you really are) | Holstenoffer sighs. "Goddesses save me, Jack! First yeh showup dressed out like a girl; now yeh say yeh're the old Lord's daughter and true heir? It's getting so a man can't keep his own head straight. Well, if it's true, yeh can count on Holstenoffer to back yeh up. But yeh're gonna need a lot more help than a fat old butcher from the country." |
| Ascension (before he knows who you really are) | Holstenofffer shrugs. "Rules of the throne are tricky, Jack. I never did understand 'em. Yeh'd do better askin someone else about that." |
| Ascension (after he knows who you really are, first time) | "First yeh want to be a princess, now yeh want to be Queen?" Holstenoffer spreads his arms wide in a disbelieving shrug, slopping bloody suet from his cleaver onto the walls. "Now look here, Jack -- er, Jacqueline -- er, Jack! Dammit, this whole mess has me head spinnin. I need to sit down a moment." |
| Ascension (after he knows who you really are, subsequent times) | He shakes his head. "I don't know, Jack. This is all just too crazy." |
| Toresal | He smiles ruefully. "It was a good town, yeh know... until the old Lord died." |
| Kingdom | "The kingdom's been peaceful for as long as I can remember -- the clan wars were all before I was born, yeh know. Mark my words though, that Baron will bring it all to ruin." |
| Taxes | He waves his cleaver. "Eh, don't talk to me about taxes. The Baron's been gettin more and more greedy every year, and he's not takin care of the land. There'll be a price to pay when Fossville is fully recognized as the new Lord, but it's us workin folk who'll bear the cost." |
| Clans | "There's some that still hold to the clan ways over the mountains," Holstenoffer says, "though it's been a long time since the clans played any part in the kingdom's politics." |
| Sea | Holstenoffer glances at his tattoos. "Truth be told, Jack, most my sailin days were all on river boats. Never been down to the sea. Like to hitch a ride on a tall ship some day, though. Wouldn't that be something?" |
| Small Woods | "Never been up there, meself. Heard it's quiet and peaceful there." |
| Mermaid Fountain | "Never heard of it." |
| Secret Passage (before he knows who you really are) | "Secret passages, Jack? Yeh've been listenin' to too many of Bobby's tall tales." |
| Secret Passage (after he knows who you really are) | "Be careful, young lady," Holstenoffer warns. "Yeh're talkin about things that're dangerous to know. Don't be messin with those things less you've a trusted friend by yer side." |
