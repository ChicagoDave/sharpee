# Chapter II - The Bakery and Germaise

## 2. Bakery

**Description:** 
The air is heavy with the warm and slightly damp smell of freshly baked bread, and the wooden counters are piled high with golden loaves, baguettes, and rolls. You can leave the bakery to the south.

## NPC: Baker (Germaise)

**Initial Appearance:** 
A man dressed in flour-dusted baker's whites stands behind the counter, watching you expectantly.

**Description:** 
Germaise the Baker is a tall, thin man from the south. He has a thick accent and likes to stroke his sparse moustaches with his fingertips while he talks -- the lower half of his face is almost always covered with a grayish coating of flour. He's a gossip and a shameless flirt, always eyeballing the young ladies who come into his store. It's moments like those that make you grateful for your disguise.

### Idle Actions (at random):
- Germaise strokes his moustaches idly.
- Germaise works on a mound of dough, pounding and pushing it into shape.
- Germaise rolls several strips of pastry dough into a complicated shape, then slides it onto something that looks like a flat-bladed shovel. Then he turns and shoves the end of the shovel into the glowing mouth of the brick oven behind him.
- Germaise peers into his oven, checking on the status of his latest batch of rolls.

## Conversation Table (with Germaise):

| Subject | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Me | "You live with the Maidens, yes?" he says with a shrug. "I should know more about you?" |
| Mercenaries | Germaise shakes his head. "When I see steel, I mind my own business." |
| Bobby | At the mention of Bobby's name, the thin man stiffens. "You see Bobby, you tell him, yes? He comes around here again, he gets the wrong end of this bread knife!" |
| Teisha | Germaise smiles. "Lovely girl, that Teisha. I send her my best pastries, maybe she gives me a discount, little something for the wife, yes?" |
| Father | He shrugs. "Theresa's never mentioned him. If he loved your mother, I guess he wasn't so bad, but who knows?" |
| Mother | "Theresa was talking about you last time she came in here, mentioned your mother. Beautiful woman, very kind, she says. Died when you were very young, yes?" Germaise strokes his moustache solemnly. "Sad, very sad. But without a proper home and husband, I guess it's no surprise." |
| Maiden House | "Fine women, those. They do good work, taking in orphans like you. I give them discounts," he adds, proudly. |
| Fossville | Germaise busies himself with a pile of dough, obviously reluctant to be drawn into discussing politics. "Eh, Fossville seems a good enough man. They say he has a temper, but it's not my place to criticize." |
| Black Gate Estate | "Black Gate Estate, that is where Baron Fossville stays when he is in the city. He throws parties there, places big orders with my shop." He shrugs, rubbing ruefully at his moustache. "What can I say? He is a good customer." |
| Red Gate Estate | "The old Duke, goddesses keep his soul, stayed at Red State. I brought fresh loaves to his doorstep every morning." Germaise rubs his moustaches sadly. "A good man, he was, and a good lord. I miss him." |
| Jacob's Mansion | "Bah!" Germaise waves a hand in the air, flicking a puff of flour from his long fingers. "They hire their own cooks and never buy anything from town. They say they are merchants, but of what? No one knows. I will say it -- they are thieves!" |
| Jacobs | Germaise shakes his head. "Just like his father, that boy is. Thinks he owns everything, and what he doesn't own he takes, and what he can't take he steals. But money always opens doors in this city. Even bad money." |
| Commerce Street | "You know this street was planned and built by the old lord of Toresal, yes?" Germaise nods and strokes his moustaches. They were to expand it too, open up the block north of here, but then the lord died so unexpectedly. Shame." |
| Grubber's Market | "Eh, it's an eyesore, but it keeps the money going round and round," says Germaise. "Half the people in this city couldn't survive without it." |
| Lord's Market | "Now that's a lovely place," Germaise says, beaming. "I send a cart out there every day and sell out by the time the bells ring noon. Rich people love their sweets," he laughs. |
| Lord's Keep | "Duke Toresal built that keep. Laid the foundation stones with his own two hands." Germaise gets a faraway look in his eye that you usually only see when he talks about his homeland. "Now there was a bright and honorable Lord. He'd have been in line for the throne if he hadn't married below his station. Bah, palace politics. It's no use to try to understand." |
| Ball | "A ball?" Germaise perks up a bit. "At the Lord's Keep, yes? It's been a long time since we held a big party up there. I'll have to keep the ovens fired all night and day to keep up with it, you can be sure." |
| Queen | Germaise makes a short, dismissive noise -- *"Pfff!"* -- blowing a cloud of flour from his lips. "The old king valued a pretty face over a sharp mind. I won't say more about that. But now that the king's dead, the kingdom suffers for his choice." |
| Princess | Germaise smirks. "The Queen's daughter is a prize that no one wants to win, but to win it means the crown. That is a difficult choice for anyone honorable, yes? I tell you, the throne has dark days ahead." |
| Spies | "Spies? The King has always employed spies, and after he died the Queen continues to employ them. They keep her appraised of what is happening in her kingdom, and an honest man has nothing to fear from them." He chuckles, "I even used to know some of them, in the old days. They changed them all around since the king's death, though. If any are around here, I wouldn't know them anymore." |
| Jail | Germaise shakes a white-dusted finger at you. "A boy like you should stay out of trouble and not think about such a filthy place." |
| Rooftops | "I better not catch you up there, yes?" he warns. "It's not safe." |
| Food | A smile spreads across Germaise's flour-streaked face. "What can I interest you in?" he asks. "I have round breads and flat breads, grain breads and white breads, hard breads and soft breads, long loaves and demi-loaves. I make rolls, muffins, pastries, cakes, and the most delicious fried dough you will ever taste. It is no joke to say that my buns are the most firm and delicious in all of Toresal." |
| Sewers | "The sewers are a place to avoid," Germaise warns you. "There are rumors that thieves and scoundrels and worse hide down there, and traverse the city through the tunnels." |
| Inheritance | Germaise laughs. "Inheritance? Where your fancies take you, boy, I just don't know. Hope that you inherited some wits, so that you can learn a trade and live a good life." |
| Ascension | "Bah. I do not think of crown politics. I make my voice heard when the time comes, but it is not my voice that decides things. The local regent reports the people's sentiment to the court." |
| Toresal | "It's a good city to live in," Germaise says, stroking his moustache. "There is respect for the law here, and money to be made if you work hard and stay smart. It cannot compare in beauty to the cities of my beloved southlands," he sighs, " but it lacks in aesthetics, it makes up for in opportunity." |
| Kingdom | "It's a good time for the kingdom nowadays. The king's law is respected, and there have been no clan wars in over a century." Germaise sighs. "I hope it lasts." |
| Taxes | "There is no use in complaining about taxes," says Germaise. "But they are not too much of a burden." |
| Clans | "Don't you read your history?" smirks Germaise. "Before the rule of the southern crown, there were dozens of clans fighting over land, cattle, daughters... it was an era of barbarians, yes? We are better off today, you can be sure." |
| Sea | Germaise gives a theatrical shudder. "Ships. You couldn't get me on a ship at swordpoint, not even the river boats or coastal shuttles. Awful things." |
| Small Woods | "Those woods are for the lord's private hunting, but the old Duke always kept them open to the public. A romantic place to take your girl, yes?" |
| Mermaid Fountain | "Ah, yes, I remember that fountain," Germaise says, stroking his moustaches. "A beautiful garden around it, wonderful place to take your sweetheart. It fell into disrepair since the Duke died, more's the shame." |
| Secret Passage | "Eh? Secret passage?" Germaise looks at you suspiciously. "I don't know anything about it, but it sounds like the kind of thing you shouldn't be messing with -- or talking about. Talk like that gets you into trouble with the King's spies, it will." |

## Objects in the Bakery

### Object: Bread
**Command [examining, smelling, eating, tasting, buying, touching, or doing pretty much anything to the bread]:** 
It looks and smells delicious, but right now you need answers more than you need a snack.

### Object: Brick Oven
**Description:** 
Most of the shop's back wall is actually the front of Germaise's huge brick oven. A warm, orange glow and the delicious smells of baking bread drift from its wide opening.

**Command [doing anything to the oven other than looking at it]:** 
It's behind the counter, and Germaise wouldn't want you messing with it in any case.
