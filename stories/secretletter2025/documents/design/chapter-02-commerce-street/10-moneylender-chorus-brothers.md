# Chapter II - The Moneylender (Chorus Brothers)

## 7. Moneylender (Chorus Brothers)

**Description:** 
The inside of this shop is dark -- dark wood paneling on the walls; deep, wine-dark carpeting on the floor; even a pair of huge, leather armchairs over in one corner. The back half of the room is hidden behind a wall of reinforced wood, with a wide window cut through the center.

### Object: Armchairs
**Description:** 
The armchairs are overstuffed, upholstered in rich, dark leather.

**Command [sit on/enter the chair]:** 
They look very comfortable, but it would feel awkward sitting in the chair and yelling across the room at the counter.

### First Entry Event
**Event [after entering for the first time]:** 
A moment after you enter, two faces suddenly appear at the window, each seeming to slide smoothly in from either side. They look at you with identical expressions of curiosity and a sort of mild, almost professional contempt.

"Good afternoon," says one.

"May we help you?" asks the other.

### Object: Window/Counter
**Description:** 
The window forms a sort of counter, with an ornately scrolled, brass grating that opens to the inside, allowing customers to speak with the proprietors on the other side. In fact, it appears that the *only* way to get service here is by standing up at the counter, so it's not exactly clear what the fancy chairs are for.

## NPC: The Chorus Brothers

**Initial Appearance:** 
The Chorus Brothers hover behind their window, staring at you.

**Description:** 
It's in some ways fortunate that you're not on a first-name basis with these fellows, because you'd never be able to tell them apart. Their faces are utterly identical, from the tops of their bald, cadaverous heads down to the black, dusty collars of their coats.

### Loan Requests

**Command [ask brothers for loan, before bath and before showing them the letter]:** 
The brother on the left sniffs. The brother on the right ever-so-slightly twists up the corner of his mouth.

"I think..." says one.

"...*not*," says the other.

**Command [ask brothers for loan, after bath but before showing them the letter]:** 
A pair of sympathetic smiles, perfectly identical and simultaneous, appear on the brothers' faces.

"My dear," begins one, "you certainly *look* respectable, but without..."

"... some form of credit history..." adds the other.

"...our hands our tied," finishes the first.

"Some form of collateral, someone to act as surety, some proof that you are capable of paying your debts..."

"...would help assure us that we were making..."

"... a sound *investment*."

### Showing the Letter

**Command [showing the brothers the letter proving your identity]:** 
The brothers both reach out, one with his right hand, the other with his left, and delicately take the letter from you. Their eyes flicker back and forth in unison as they scan the words. When they reach the end, four identical eyebrows shoot up.

"How very..."

"...*interesting*. It would seem you are a personage of more..."

"...*importance* than first we assumed."

They hand the letter back to you, smiling, and ask in chorus, "How may we help you?"

**Command [ask for loan after you've shown them the letter, but before you've had a bath]:** 
The brothers manage to look both pained and solicitous at the manage, with one of them handling one expression while the other handling the other.

"Of course, there is no question..."

"...of your *bona fides*. However, there is the issue of..."

"...your *presentability*, shall we say? We cannot be seen lending money to an unwashed street child, even if she does happen to be a Duke's daughter. It would attract..."

"...the wrong sort of applicant. Before we discuss the particulars of your loan, perhaps we could prevail upon you to..."

"...clean up?"

"...just a bit?"

### Getting the Loan

**Command [ask for a loan after you've had a bath *and* after you've shown them the letter]:** 
The two brothers lean forward eagerly, as though they've been waiting for you to ask.

"We would be *delighted* to extend to you..."

"...our most prestigious line of credit!"

Over the next few minutes they hand you dozens of sheets of paper covered in dense, tiny script, full of bizarre words like "amortization", "compound interest", and "escrow". Pieter tries to read some of it, with his brow furrowed up and his lips moving slightly; eventually he shakes his head and mutters, "Just sign all of them." You dutifully write your name where the brothers show you.

After it's all done, they sweep all the papers into a slim leather folder, and place a small sack of coins on the counter. "That's *it?*" complains Pieter, but when you tug open the drawstring, you see the sunlight gleam of gold.

"When you have secured your position, please remember us..." says one brother.

"...not merely as your creditors..."

"...but as your *friends.*"

And both brothers smile in unison, revealing two sets of wide, white teeth.

### Object: Bag of Coins
**Description:** 
The sack is about the size of your fist. It's very heavy. Even a little bit of gold goes a long way in Toresal, and there's more than just a little bit of gold in here. The drawstring is [closed/open].

**Command [open/close bag/pull drawstring]:** 
You pull the drawstring [open/closed].

**Command [give bag or coins to someone]:** 
Very generous of you, but you're going to need the money for yourself.

**Command [drop the bag, put the bag in/on something]:** 
It wouldn't be very wise to leave a bag full of gold coins sitting unguarded. Better keep them on your person for now.

#### Object: Gold Coins
**Description:** 
Each coin has the Great Seal of the Kingdom of Miradan on one side; the face of some old, dead king that you've never heard of on the other. You've never seen real gold before, and nothing you've ever seen is quite like it. The coins seem to shine with an inner light.

**Command [remove coins from bag]:** 
The bag is the safest place for them, for now. There's no need to take them out unless you're planning to purchase something.
