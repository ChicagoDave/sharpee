Moving from traditional parser IF to modern dynamic IF platform

5. **Rich Media** - Character portraits, mood indicators, audio cues
6. **Analytics** - Track player choices for balancing

## Sharpee-Specific Features to Leverage

  currentSpace: "public" # or "private"
  identityStress: 0-100
  revelations:
    noble: []      # who knows
    gender: []     # who knows
    spiritTouched: [] # who knows
```

### 3. Dynamic Choice Presentation
**Instead of Inform 7's:**
```
1. Hide in the alley
2. Blend with crowd  
3. Confront mercenaries
```

**Sharpee Shows:**
- Highlighted options based on skills
