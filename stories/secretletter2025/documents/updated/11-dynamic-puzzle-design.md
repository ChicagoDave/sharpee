# Dynamic Puzzle Design: Beyond Lawn-Mowing

## Core Problem with Traditional IF Puzzles
- Try every option until something works
- No real thought required
- Solutions feel arbitrary
- One right answer
- No connection to character identity

## New Puzzle Philosophy

### Every Puzzle Has Multiple Solutions
Each major obstacle can be overcome through:
1. **Street Smarts** (Jack's survival skills)
2. **Noble Knowledge** (Hidden education)
3. **Social Engineering** (Relationship based)
4. **Spirit-Touched Power** (Magical/intuitive)
5. **Gender Expression** (Identity-based solutions)

### Solutions Have Consequences
- Fast solutions may be messier
- Quiet solutions take more time
- Violent solutions affect reputation
- Magical solutions drain energy
- Each approach shapes story

## Puzzle Mechanics

### Resource Management
Every approach costs something:
- **Time**: Some solutions take longer
- **Energy**: Physical and spiritual
- **Trust**: Using people has social cost  
- **Reputation**: Actions spread
- **Health**: Dangerous solutions risk injury

### Information Puzzles
Not about finding the right person but:
- **Synthesis**: Combining partial info
- **Verification**: Confirming truth
- **Timing**: When to use knowledge
- **Trading**: Information economy
- **Protection**: Keeping secrets safe

### Social Puzzles
Multiple relationship paths:
- **Alliance Building**: Long-term investment
- **Manipulation**: Short-term gain
- **Genuine Connection**: Emotional cost/reward
- **Transaction**: Clear exchanges
- **Deception**: Risk of discovery

### Identity Puzzles
Using Jack's nature strategically:
- **Code-Switching**: Right identity for situation
- **Revelation Timing**: When to show truth
- **Presentation**: How to appear
- **Integration**: Combining aspects
- **Authenticity vs Strategy**: The balance

## Dynamic Difficulty

### Adaptive Challenge
Puzzles adjust based on:
- Player's chosen approach style

- Relationships built
- Previous solutions
- Current game state

### Failure Forwarding
"Wrong" solutions don't end game:

- Affect relationships
- Shape story differently

### Time Pressure Variations
Not all puzzles patient:
