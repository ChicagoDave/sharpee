## Updated Major NPCs

### Bobby
**Age**: 16
**Gender**: Male
**Role**: Jack's closest friend and confidant

**Updated Background**:
Bobby has known Jack's secret for over a year. He discovered it by accident but immediately accepted her, becoming her fiercest protector and closest friend. Their relationship is complex - deep friendship with potential romantic undertones that the player can explore or keep platonic.

**Key Moments**:
- Calls her "Jackie" in private, "Jack" in public
- Gives her small gifts that affirm her identity (ribbons, flowers)
- Fights anyone who threatens to expose her
- His "death" and return become even more emotionally charged

### Fiona (Maiden House)
**Age**: 40s
**Role**: Mother figure and secret tutor

**Updated Background**:
Fiona was more than just Lord Toresal's friend - she was his confidant regarding Jack's identity. She's spent years teaching Jack not just noble skills but how to survive as her true self in a complex world. She keeps a chest of dresses that "might fit a young lady someday" and teaches Jack courtly graces in secret.

**Key Moments**:
- Reveals she has letters from Jack's father about accepting his "daughter"
- Teaches Jack that being true to oneself requires both courage and strategy
- Provides the key emotional support during identity reveals

### Baron Fossville
**Updated Motivations**:
The Baron discovers Jack's transgender identity through his spy network and sees it as the perfect weapon. He believes he can use medieval law's gendered language about "male heirs" to invalidate her claim entirely. However, he underestimates both Jack's resilience and the loyalty she inspires.

**New Dialogue Examples**:
- "The law speaks of 'sons,' not daughters who play pretend."
- "Your father's madness extends even beyond the grave - acknowledging a boy who thinks himself a girl!"
- (In the war room) "Even if you were legitimate, what court would recognize... whatever you are?"

### The Magician Tribe (New Characters)

#### Elder Saphira
**Age**: Ancient
**Role**: Leader of the Magician Tribe

**Description**:
A wise woman who transcended conventional understanding of gender centuries ago. She sees souls, not bodies, and recognizes Jack's true essence immediately. She becomes the maternal figure Jack never had.

**Key Dialogue**:
- "The body is merely clothing for the soul, child. We can tailor it to fit."
- "Your father sought us out once. He asked if we could help his child become who she truly was. We told him to wait until you were ready to choose for yourself."

#### Zeph
**Age**: 17
**Gender**: Non-binary
**Role**: Jack's guide and potential friend

**Description**:
A young magician who underwent their own transformation years ago. They become Jack's guide to understanding the possibilities and responsibilities of magical transformation. Their presence shows Jack she's not alone in her journey.

#### The Wishkeeper
**Age**: Timeless
**Role**: The one who grants the transformation

**Description**:
An ethereal being who guards the transformation magic. They require not just the wish but understanding of what it truly means. The ritual involves Jack confronting her deepest truths and fears.

## Updated Minor NPCs

### Teisha (Market Girl)
Now serves as an interesting mirror - she and Jack look alike, leading to moments where Jack sees who she could have been in different circumstances. Teisha's casual femininity both pains and inspires Jack.

### The Chorus Brothers (Moneylenders)
Their willingness to "invest" in Jack takes on new meaning when they learn her full truth. One brother is dismissive, the other surprisingly supportive, creating conflict that Jack must navigate.

### Mrs. Sandler (Jeweler)
Becomes a crucial ally who knew Jack's mother and father's full story. She's been saving not just the necklace but a letter from Jack's mother that affirms her daughter's identity.

### Pieter (Guard/Spy)
His protection of Jack deepens when he learns her truth. Having seen suffering in his spy work, he's moved by her courage and becomes even more determined to see her safe.
