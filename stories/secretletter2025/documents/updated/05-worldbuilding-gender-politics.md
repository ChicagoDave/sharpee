# World-Building: Gender and Politics in Miradania

## Core Concept
The Kingdom of Miradania is not inherently prejudiced against transgender people, but gender becomes a tool for political manipulation. This creates a more nuanced conflict where Jack faces opposition not from blind hatred, but from those who would use any weapon to maintain or gain power.

## Historical Context

### Ancient Miradania
- The Magician Tribes recognized gender fluidity for millennia
- Old religions honored dual-spirit individuals as bridges between worlds
- Ancient texts use neutral terms for rulers: "Sovereign," "Heir," "Crown-Bearer"

### The Codification Period (200 years ago)
- Written laws replaced oral traditions
- Gendered language entered legal codes through translation errors and political maneuvering
- "Male primogeniture" became standard, though exceptions existed
- The Magician Tribes withdrew from public life

### Recent History
- Several noble houses quietly had transgender members
- The Crown traditionally turned a blind eye if succession wasn't threatened
- Baron Fossville's faction pushed for stricter interpretation of old laws
- Queen's reign saw both progress and backlash

## Legal Framework

### Inheritance Law
**The Ambiguity:**
- Old texts say "eldest son" (mistranslation of "eldest child")
- Precedent exists for female inheritance when no "sons"
- No explicit law about transgender heirs
- Magic-recognized claims vs. legal claims

**The Loophole:**
- Magical authentication of bloodline supersedes written law
- Ancient treaty with Magician Tribes still technically valid
- Royal decree can override common law
- Popular acclaim has historical weight

### The Baron's Legal Strategy
Uses selective interpretation:
- "The law clearly states 'son'"
- "Magical trickery cannot change nature"
- "The stability of the realm requires clarity"
- "Precedent must be maintained"

### Counter-Arguments
Jack's supporters argue:
- "The heir's soul is recognized by ancient magic"
- "Letter of law vs. spirit of law"
- "The Duke acknowledged his daughter"
- "Royal blood flows regardless of form"

## Social Attitudes

### Common People
**Generally pragmatic:**
- Care more about fair rule than gender
- Familiar with shapeshifting from fairy tales
- Judge by actions, not identity
- Split based on political allegiance

**Regional Variations:**
- Border regions: More accepting (Magician Tribe influence)
- Capital: Politically divided
- Merchant cities: Focused on stability/profit
- Rural areas: Traditional but not hostile

### Nobility
**Politically motivated positions:**
- Progressive nobles see opportunity for alliance
- Conservative nobles fear change to succession
- Pragmatists calculate advantages
- Most care about power, not principles

### Merchant Class
**Economic concerns primary:**
- Stability matters most
- Some see opportunity in change
- Others fear disruption
- Will back likely winner

## Political Factions

### The Traditionalists (Baron's faction)
**Public Position:**
- "Maintaining legal precedent"
- "Protecting ancient customs"
- "Ensuring clear succession"
- "Preventing magical corruption"

**Private Reality:**

### The Crown's Position
**The Queen's Dilemma:**
- Knows Jack is legitimate heir
- Fears civil war
- Calculates political costs
- Weighs personal vs. royal duty

**Potential Stances:**
1. Full recognition (risky but just)
2. Conditional acceptance (political compromise)
3. Delayed decision (buying time)
4. Creative solution (magical arbitration)

## The Magician Tribe's Role

### Historical Neutrality

### Fashion and Presentation
