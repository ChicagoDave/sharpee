# Enhanced Gameplay Mechanics for YA Audience

## Core Gameplay Philosophy
Move from linear "on rails" storytelling to meaningful player agency where choices matter and create different story experiences. Every major scene should have at least 2-3 different approaches, with consequences that ripple forward.

## Choice & Consequence System

### Identity Expression Choices
Players control when and how Jack reveals aspects of her identity:

**Public Presentation**
- Maintain boy disguise (safer but emotionally taxing)
- Drop subtle hints about true identity (risky but builds allies)
- Openly present as female (dangerous but liberating)

**Private Moments**
- How much to share with trusted allies
- Whether to correct pronouns in safe spaces
- Choosing feminine or masculine coded actions

### Dialogue Trees
Every significant conversation has multiple options:

**Tone Options**
1. Defiant/Brave ("I know who I am")
2. Strategic/Careful ("Let them think what they want")
3. Vulnerable/Honest ("I'm tired of hiding")
4. Humorous/Deflecting ("You should see me in a dress")

**Information Control**
- What to reveal and when
- Who to trust with which secrets
- How to use knowledge strategically

## Relationship System

### Trust Mechanics
Each NPC has hidden trust values affected by:
- Consistency in interactions
- Shared vulnerabilities
- Completed favors or quests
- Dialogue choices
- Identity revelations

### Relationship Paths

**Bobby Route**
- Best Friend → Protector → Potential Romance
- Player choices determine relationship evolution
- Special scenes unlock at high trust

**Maiden House Dynamics**
- Individual relationships with each woman
- Group reputation affects available help
- Mother figure can be chosen (Fiona, Shannon, or others)

**Antagonist Manipulation**
- Can attempt to deceive Baron/mercenaries
- Play political factions against each other
- Convert enemies to neutral parties

## Puzzle Diversification

### Social Puzzles
**Example: Getting Past the Guard**
- Option 1: Bribe (requires money)
- Option 2: Distraction (requires Bobby's help)
- Option 3: Disguise (requires clothing item)
- Option 4: Emotional appeal (requires backstory knowledge)
- Option 5: Blackmail (requires prior information gathering)

### Investigation Mechanics
**Information Gathering**
- Multiple sources for each crucial fact
- Partial information from different NPCs
- Player must piece together truth
- Red herrings and false leads
- Optional side investigations

### Stealth Variations
**Infiltrating Black Gate Estate**
- Path 1: Sewers (dirty but safe)
- Path 2: Servant disguise (social challenge)
- Path 3: Rooftops (physical challenge)
- Path 4: Front door with forged invitation (preparation required)

## Resource Management

### Emotional Energy
- Maintaining disguises drains energy
- Authentic moments restore energy
- Low energy affects dialogue options
- Crisis moments require energy reserves

### Money System
- Start with limited funds
- Earn through jobs/favors
- Spend on: disguises, bribes, information, comfort items
- Optional "gender-affirming" purchases (ribbons, etc.)

### Inventory Expansion
**Identity Items**

- Father's signet ring
- Hair ribbons from Bobby
- Fiona's gifted items
- Comfort objects

**Practical Items**
- Weapons (concealed)

### Chapter 4: Meeting Bobby
**Branching Paths**

### Chapter 7: Underground
