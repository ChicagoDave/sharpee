# Work Summary - July 2, 2025, 18:50

## Overview
Addressed critical build system issues in the Sharpee IF engine monorepo. Identified root causes of TypeScript compilation failures and implemented fixes for developer experience across three personas: platform developers, extension developers, and story developers.

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Mixed Package Manager Configuration
- Lerna configured to use npm while packages use pnpm workspace protocol
- Fixed by updating `lerna.json` to use pnpm as npmClient

### 2. TypeScript Path Mapping Conflicts
- Base tsconfig contained path mappings causing "rootDir" errors during builds
- Created separate `tsconfig.dev.json` for development with path mappings
- Cleaned `tsconfig.base.json` for production builds without path mappings

### 3. Missing Module Type Declarations
- Packages missing `"type": "module"` in package.json
- Added to all core packages: core, world-model, event-processor, stdlib, lang-en-us, engine

### 4. Circular Build Dependencies
- Engine package had `prepare` script causing build during `pnpm install`
- Removed prepare scripts to allow manual build ordering

### 5. TypeScript Composite Mode Issues
- Packages configured with `composite: true` but only emitting declaration files
- No JavaScript files being generated despite correct configuration
- Root cause: TypeScript project references may only emit declarations in certain configurations

## Changes Made

### Configuration Files
1. **lerna.json**: Changed npmClient from "npm" to "pnpm"
2. **tsconfig.base.json**: Removed all path mappings
3. **tsconfig.dev.json**: Created with path mappings for development
4. **package.json files**: Added `"type": "module"` to all packages
5. **engine/package.json**: Removed `prepare` script

### Build Scripts
1. **build.sh**: Created ordered build script for all packages
2. **clean-build.sh**: Created script to clean all artifacts and rebuild
3. **Root package.json**: Updated scripts to use pnpm commands

### Documentation
Created comprehensive guides for each developer persona:
- `docs/README.md`: Main entry point
- `docs/platform/getting-started.md`: Platform developer guide
- `docs/extensions/getting-started.md`: Extension developer guide  
- `docs/stories/getting-started.md`: Story developer guide

## Current State

### What's Working
- Package manager consistency (pnpm throughout)
- Clean separation of dev/prod TypeScript configs
- Documentation structure for all developer personas
- Build order is correct

### What's Not Working
- TypeScript only emitting declaration files, not JavaScript
- Packages can't resolve dependencies during build
- Composite project references not functioning as expected

## Next Steps

1. **Fix JavaScript Emission**
   - Investigate why TypeScript isn't emitting .js files
   - Consider removing composite mode temporarily
   - May need explicit `emitDeclarationOnly: false` in configs

2. **Simplify Build Process**
   - Consider using build tools like Turborepo or Nx
   - Or simplify to basic tsc without project references

3. **Complete Story Developer Experience**
   - Create CLI tool for story developers
   - Add story template project
   - Implement hot reload for development

4. **Test Full Build Chain**
   - Ensure all packages build in order
   - Verify Cloak of Darkness story runs
   - Test with fresh clone

## Key Insights

1. **TypeScript Composite Mode Complexity**: Project references with composite mode add significant complexity and may not be worth it for this project size

2. **Developer Persona Separation**: Clear separation of concerns for different developer types is crucial:
   - Platform devs need full monorepo access
   - Extension devs need simple npm package workflow
   - Story devs need CLI tools to hide complexity

3. **Build Order Matters**: Dependencies must be built before dependents, requiring either:
   - Manual ordering (current approach)
   - Build orchestration tool
   - Removal of workspace protocol in favor of relative paths

4. **Module Resolution**: ES modules + TypeScript + monorepo creates complex resolution issues that need careful configuration

## Recommended Architecture

For next session, consider:
1. Remove TypeScript composite/project references
2. Use simple tsc builds per package
3. Implement Turborepo for build orchestration
4. Create separate "getting started" repos for each persona
5. Focus on story developer CLI as primary interface
