Only knows about high-level game concepts (rooms, things, players)\n2. Doesn't know about the graph implementation\n3. Uses WorldModel's methods for all operations\n4. Works with domain objects rather than nodes/edges\n5. Uses a proper abstraction layer\n\nThe WorldModel would need to implement all these operations using the graph underneath, but the game logic remains clean and focused on game concepts.\n\nWould you like me to show how the WorldModel would implement some of these methods using the graph database underneath?",
