Project Structure Changes - ✓ Complete\n- Workspace definitions in root package.json have been updated\n- Path aliases have been added to tsconfig.base.json\n\n### 2. Package Configuration - Partially Complete\n- Core package.json has been updated with proper configuration\n- Standard library package.json has been updated\n- Most extension packages have been updated, but there might be outstanding work for setting proper peerDependencies on core\n\n### 3. Code Architecture Changes - ✓ Complete\n- Extension registry has been created in `packages/core/src/extensions/registry.ts`\n- Clear extension interfaces have been established\n- Mirror-specific code has been moved to extensions package\n- Imports have been updated to use path aliases\n\n### 4. Public API Design - Needs Work\n- Index.ts exports need review to ensure clean public APIs\n- Umbrella package setup is pending\n- API documentation for each package is needed\n\n### 5. Build and Test Configuration - Partially Complete\n- tsconfig.json files are set up for most packages\n- Build scripts in package.json files are configured\n- Jest configuration for path aliases may need updating\n\n### 6. Publishing Preparation - Not Started\n- .npmignore files for packages\n- CI/CD setup for publishing\n\n## Current Architecture\n\nThe codebase shows a well-thought-out architecture with several key components:\n\n1. **World Model**: An entity-relationship system with immutable state management\n2. **Event System**: A semantic event system with event types, tags, and processing\n3. **Channel System**: A system for routing events to output channels\n4. **Command Execution**: A command handling system with router and handlers\n5. **Extension System**: A registry and interface system for extensions\n6. **Parser Framework**: Core types for parsing commands (implementation needs work)\n\n## Next Steps\n\nBased on your refactor list and the current state, I recommend focusing on:\n\n1. **Complete Package Dependencies**:\n   - Ensure all extension packages have proper peerDependencies on core\n\n2. **Clean Public API Design**:\n   - Review and clean up index.ts exports in each package\n   - Create the umbrella \"sharpee\" package for easy import\n\n3. **Parser Implementation**:\n   - The parser system has types defined but appears to need implementation work\n   - This could be a major focus area since it's critical for IF functionality\n\n4. **Command Handlers**:\n   - Expand standard library command handlers beyond the look handler\n   - Implement common IF verbs (take, drop, inventory, etc.)\n\n5. **Documentation**:\n   - Add README.md files to each package with usage examples\n   - Document public APIs\n\n6. **Testing**:\n   - Ensure Jest is properly configured for path aliases\n   - Write more comprehensive unit tests for core functionality\n\nWould you like to focus on any particular area? Based on your Sharpee framework description, I think the parser implementation and expanding command handlers would provide the most value for moving toward a functional IF engine.",
