Could you please provide the content of this file, particularly around line 26 where the error is occurring? \n\nWithout seeing the exact code, I can make an educated guess about what might be happening:\n\n1.

Update `StoryRunner.cs`:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing DataStore;\nusing IFWorldModel;\nusing ParserLibrary;\n\nnamespace IFEngine\n{\n    public class StoryRunner\n    {\n        private readonly Parser _parser;\n        private readonly ActionHandlers _actionHandlers;\n        private readonly ActionHistory _history;\n        private readonly Guid _playerId;\n        private readonly Graph _graph;\n        private readonly Scope _scope;\n\n        public StoryRunner(Graph graph, Guid playerId)\n        {\n            _graph = graph ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(graph));\n            _playerId = playerId;\n            _scope = new Scope(graph, playerId);\n            _parser = new Parser(_scope);\n            _actionHandlers = new ActionHandlers(graph, _scope);\n            _history = new ActionHistory(graph);\n        }\n\n        public void Run()\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Welcome to the Interactive Fiction Game!\");\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Type 'quit' to exit the game.\");\n\n            while (true)\n            {\n                Console.Write(\"\\n> \");\n                var input = Console.ReadLine();\n\n                if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(input))\n                    continue;\n\n                if (input.ToLower() == \"quit\")\n                    break;\n\n                var parseResult = _parser.Parse(input);\n                if (!parseResult.Success)\n                {\n                    Console.WriteLine(parseResult.Message);\n                    continue;\n                }\n\n                var actionResult = _actionHandlers.Execute(parseResult.Action, _playerId);\n                _history.AddAction(actionResult);\n\n                Console.WriteLine(actionResult.Message);\n\n                _scope.UpdateScope(); // Update scope after each action\n            }\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Thank you for playing!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nKey changes in `StoryRunner.cs`:\n- Changed `_playerId` from `string` to `Guid`.\n- Added `_scope` field and initialized it in the constructor.\n- Updated `Parser` initialization to pass `_scope`.\n- Changed `ActionEx` to `ActionHandlers` and updated its initialization.\n- Updated the main loop to use the new `Parser.Parse()` return type (which is now `ActionResult`).\n- Added `_scope.UpdateScope()` after each action to keep the scope up-to-date.\n\n2. Update `Parser.cs`:\n\nThe `Parse` method in `Parser` should return an `ActionResult` instead of a `ParsedAction`. Update the `Parse` method in `Parser.cs`:\n\n```csharp\npublic ActionResult Parse(string input)\n{\n    var tokens = TokenizeInput(input);\n    foreach (var verb in _verbs)\n    {\n        var matchResult = TryMatchVerbPattern(verb, tokens);\n        if (matchResult != null)\n        {\n            if (IsValidAction(matchResult))\n            {\n                return new ActionResult(matchResult, true, \"Valid command\");\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                return new ActionResult(matchResult, false, GetOutOfScopeMessage(matchResult));\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return new ActionResult(new ParsedAction(\"unknown\"), false, \"I don't understand that command.\");\n}\n```\n\n3. Update `ActionHandlers.cs`:\n\nRename `ActionEx` to `ActionHandlers` in the file, and update the `Execute` method:\n\n```csharp\npublic class ActionHandlers\n{\n    private readonly Graph _graph;\n    private readonly Dictionary<string, MethodInfo> _actionMethods;\n    private readonly Scope _scope;\n\n    public ActionHandlers(Graph graph, Scope scope)\n    {\n        _graph = graph;\n        _scope = scope;\n        _actionMethods = new Dictionary<string, MethodInfo>(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);\n        RegisterActionMethods();\n    }\n\n    public ActionResult Execute(ParsedAction action, Guid playerId)\n    {\n        if (_actionMethods.TryGetValue(action.Verb, out var method))\n        {\n            return (ActionResult)method.Invoke(this, new object[] { action, playerId });\n        }\n        return new ActionResult(action, false, \"I don't know how to do that.\");\n    }\n\n    // ... rest of the class\n}\n```\n\n4. Update any other files that use `StoryRunner`, `Parser`, or `ActionHandlers` to reflect these changes.\n\nThese updates should resolve the inconsistencies in the `StoryRunner` class and align it with the rest of your codebase. The main changes are:\n\n- Using `Guid` for player ID instead of `string`.\n- Introducing `Scope` to manage what's in scope for the player.\n- Updating the parsing and action execution flow to use `ActionResult` consistently.\n\nMake sure to update any other parts of your code that might be affected by these changes.

It now takes a `Graph` and a `Scope` in its constructor, allowing it to access both the game state and the current scope of visible/accessible items.\n\n2. The `Execute` method now takes a `Guid` for the player ID instead of a `string`.\n\n3. The `GetPlayer` method has been updated to work with `Guid` IDs.\n\n4. Each action method (`Look`, `Take`, `Drop`, `Inventory`) has been adapted to work with the `INode` interface and the `Scope` class.\n\n5. The `Take` and `Drop` methods now update the scope after changing the game state.\n\n6. All methods return `ActionResult` objects, which include whether the action was successful and a message describing the result.\n\n7. The class uses the `ActionMethodAttribute` to dynamically register action methods, allowing for easy addition of new actions.\n\nThis implementation should now be consistent with the rest of your codebase and work seamlessly with the `StoryRunner` and `Parser` classes we discussed earlier.

It now takes a `Graph` and a `Scope` in its constructor, allowing it to access both the game state and the current scope of visible/accessible items.\n\n2. The `Execute` method now takes a `Guid` for the player ID instead of a `string`.\n\n3. The `GetPlayer` method has been updated to work with `Guid` IDs.\n\n4. Each action method (`Look`, `Take`, `Drop`, `Inventory`) has been adapted to work with the `INode` interface and the `Scope` class.\n\n5. The `Take` and `Drop` methods now update the scope after changing the game state.\n\n6. All methods return `ActionResult` objects, which include whether the action was successful and a message describing the result.\n\n7. The class uses the `ActionMethodAttribute` to dynamically register action methods, allowing for easy addition of new actions.\n\nThis implementation should now be consistent with the rest of your codebase and work seamlessly with the `StoryRunner` and `Parser` classes we discussed earlier. If you need any further modifications or have any questions about this implementation, please let me know!",
