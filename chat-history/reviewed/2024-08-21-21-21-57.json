The dependency injection container doesn't know how to create a Guid directly.\n\nTo fix this, we need to modify how we're registering the playerId. Here's what we can do:\n\n1. Modify the StoryRunner to accept a Func<Guid> instead of a Guid directly.\n2. Update the registration in Program.cs to provide this Func<Guid>.\n\nLet's update the StoryRunner:\n\n<antArtifact identifier=\"story-runner-update\" type=\"application/vnd.ant.code\" language=\"csharp\" title=\"Updated StoryRunner.cs\">\nusing System;\nusing DataStore;\nusing IFWorldModel;\nusing ParserLibrary;\n\nnamespace IFEngine\n{\n    public class StoryRunner\n    {\n        private readonly Parser _parser;\n        private readonly ActionHandlers _actionHandlers;\n        private readonly Func<Guid> _getPlayerId;\n        private readonly Graph _graph;\n        private readonly Scope _scope;\n\n        public StoryRunner(Graph graph, Func<Guid> getPlayerId)\n        {\n            _graph = graph ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(graph));\n            _getPlayerId = getPlayerId ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(getPlayerId));\n            var playerId = _getPlayerId();\n            _scope = new Scope(graph, playerId.ToString());\n            _parser = new Parser(_scope);\n            _actionHandlers = new ActionHandlers(graph, _scope);\n        }\n\n        public void Run()\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Welcome to the Interactive Fiction Game!\");\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Type 'quit' to exit the game.\");\n\n            while (true)\n            {\n                Console.Write(\"\\n> \");\n                var input = Console.ReadLine();\n\n                if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(input))\n                    continue;\n\n                if (input.ToLower() == \"quit\")\n                    break;\n\n                var parseResult = _parser.Parse(input);\n                if (!parseResult.Success)\n                {\n                    Console.WriteLine(parseResult.Message);\n                    continue;\n                }\n\n                var actionResult = _actionHandlers.Execute(parseResult.Action, _getPlayerId());\n\n                Console.WriteLine(actionResult.Message);\n\n                _scope.UpdateScope();\n            }\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Thank you for playing!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n</antArtifact>\n\nNow, we don't need to change the Program.cs file. The existing registration should work:\n\n```csharp\nservices.AddSingleton(sp => {\n    var story = sp.GetRequiredService<IStory>();\n    return story.GetPlayerId();\n});\n```\n\nThis registers a factory method that returns a Guid, which matches our new StoryRunner constructor.\n\nThese changes should resolve the dependency injection issue without modifying the Program.cs file. The StoryRunner now accepts a function to get the player ID instead of the ID itself, which allows for more flexibility and resolves the dependency injection problem.",
