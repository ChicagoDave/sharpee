Removed all references to CloakOfDarknessStory or any other specific story implementation.\n\n2. If no valid IStory implementation is found, the program now exits with an error message instead of falling back to a default story.\n\n3. Removed the StandardLibrary using statement as it's no longer needed in this file.\n\n4. The program now relies entirely on finding a valid IStory implementation in a DLL in the execution directory.\n\nThis approach makes the Program completely agnostic of any particular story implementation. It will work with any story that implements the IStory interface, as long as the DLL containing the implementation is present in the execution directory.\n\nTo use this system:\n\n1. Story authors would create their own projects implementing the IStory interface.\n2. They would compile their stories into DLLs.\n3. To play a specific story, the user would place the story DLL in the same directory as the IF engine executable.\n4. When run, the engine would automatically load and use the story implementation from the DLL.\n\nThis design provides maximum flexibility and separation between the engine and individual stories, allowing for easy distribution and swapping of different Interactive Fiction games.",

The `<Exec>` element runs a command-line instruction.\n4. The command uses `xcopy` to copy the built DLL (`$(TargetPath)`) to the output directory of the StoryRunner project (`$(SolutionDir)StoryRunner\\$(OutDir)`).\n5. The `/Y` switch tells xcopy to overwrite the file if it already exists without prompting.\n\nSome notes about this approach:\n\n- This assumes that your StoryRunner project (the main executable project) is in a folder named \"StoryRunner\" in the same solution directory as your MyStory project.\n- `$(SolutionDir)` is the directory containing your .sln file.\n- `$(OutDir)` is the output directory for the build configuration (like \"bin\\Debug\\net6.0\\\").\n- Make sure the StoryRunner project is set as the startup project in your solution.\n\nIf your project structure is different, you may need to adjust the paths in the xcopy command accordingly.\n\nAfter adding this to your MyStory.csproj file, every time you build the MyStory project, it will automatically copy the MyStory.dll to the StoryRunner's output directory. This ensures that when you run the StoryRunner, it will be able to find and load your story implementation.\n\nRemember to rebuild your solution after making this change to ensure the post-build event takes effect.",
