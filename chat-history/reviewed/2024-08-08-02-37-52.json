We've removed the `Contents` and `Exits` properties that stored collections directly. Instead, we now have properties that query the edges of the room node.\n\n2. `Contents` is now an `IEnumerable<Thing>` that filters edges with a \"contains\" relation type and selects the target nodes.\n\n3. `Exits` is now an `IEnumerable<(string Direction, Room Destination)>` that filters edges with an \"exit\" relation type and selects both the direction (stored as a property on the edge) and the target room.\n\n4. The `AddExit`, `AddThing`, and `RemoveThing` methods now take a `Graph` parameter, which they use to create or remove edges.\n\n5. In `AddExit`, we create an edge with \"exit\" as the relation type and store the direction as a property on the edge.\n\n6. In `AddThing`, we create an edge with \"contains\" as the relation type.\n\n7. In `RemoveThing`, we find the appropriate edge and remove it from the graph.\n\n8. We've kept the fluent interface by returning `this` from these methods.\n\nThis implementation aligns with the graph-based structure of our world model. It uses edges to represent relationships between rooms and their contents, as well as connections between rooms. The `Graph` object is now required for operations that modify the structure, ensuring that all changes are properly tracked in the central graph data store.\n\nSome potential enhancements we could consider:\n\n1. Implement methods to get specific exits or contents (e.g., `GetExit(string direction)` or `GetThing(string name)`).\n2. Add validation to ensure that only appropriate types of things can be added to a room.\n3. Implement two-way connections between rooms automatically.\n4. Add events that trigger when things are added to or removed from the room.\n\nWould you like me to implement any of these enhancements or explain any part of the implementation in more detail?",

We've removed the `Contents` and `Exits` properties that stored collections directly. Instead, we now have properties that query the edges of the room node.\n\n2. `Contents` is now an `IEnumerable<Thing>` that filters edges with a \"contains\" relation type and selects the target nodes.\n\n3. `Exits` is now an `IEnumerable<(string Direction, Room Destination)>` that filters edges with an \"exit\" relation type and selects both the direction (stored as a property on the edge) and the target room.\n\n4. The `AddExit`, `AddThing`, and `RemoveThing` methods now take a `Graph` parameter, which they use to create or remove edges.\n\n5. In `AddExit`, we create an edge with \"exit\" as the relation type and store the direction as a property on the edge.\n\n6. In `AddThing`, we create an edge with \"contains\" as the relation type.\n\n7. In `RemoveThing`, we find the appropriate edge and remove it from the graph.\n\n8. We've kept the fluent interface by returning `this` from these methods.\n\nThis implementation aligns with the graph-based structure of our world model. It uses edges to represent relationships between rooms and their contents, as well as connections between rooms. The `Graph` object is now required for operations that modify the structure, ensuring that all changes are properly tracked in the central graph data store.\n\nSome potential enhancements we could consider:\n\n1. Implement methods to get specific exits or contents (e.g., `GetExit(string direction)` or `GetThing(string name)`).\n2. Add validation to ensure that only appropriate types of things can be added to a room.\n3. Implement two-way connections between rooms automatically.\n4. Add events that trigger when things are added to or removed from the room.\n\nWould you like me to implement any of these enhancements or explain any part of the implementation in more detail?",

In the `AddExit` method:\n   - We now set both source and target properties on the edge.\n   - The source room gets an \"exit\" relation, while the target room gets an \"entrance\" relation.\n   - We calculate and set the opposite direction for the target room using the new `GetOppositeDirection` method.\n\n2. In the `AddThing` method:\n   - We now set both source and target properties on the edge.\n   - The room gets a \"contains\" relation, while the thing gets a \"containedBy\" relation.\n\n3. We've added a private `GetOppositeDirection` method to calculate the opposite direction for exits. This ensures consistency in bidirectional connections.\n\n4. The `RemoveThing` method remains unchanged, as removing the edge affects both directions implicitly.\n\n5. The `Contents` and `Exits` properties remain the same, as they only need to check the source properties to determine the relationship from the room's perspective.\n\nThese changes ensure that our graph maintains consistent bidirectional relationships. This approach allows us to:\n\n- Easily navigate the graph in both directions.\n- Maintain consistency in the world model.\n- Query relationships from either end of the connection.\n\nSome potential enhancements we could consider:\n\n1. Implement methods to get specific exits or contents (e.g., `GetExit(string direction)` or `GetThing(string name)`).\n2. Add validation to ensure that only appropriate types of things can be added to a room.\n3. Add events that trigger when things are added to or removed from the room.\n4.
