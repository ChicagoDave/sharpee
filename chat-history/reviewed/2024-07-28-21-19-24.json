It inherits from `Thing` but sets its type to \"scenery\".\n\n2. By default, it sets `movable` to false and `examinable` to true.\n\n3. It provides properties `IsMovable` and `IsExaminable` to check these attributes.\n\n4. It includes methods to set and get the description of the scenery.\n\n5. It overrides `AddToContainer` with `AddToRoom` to make it clear that scenery should be added to rooms.\n\n6. It provides a `GetRoom` method to retrieve the room the scenery is in.\n\n7. It overrides `RemoveFromContainer` and `MoveTo` to throw exceptions, as scenery shouldn't be moved.\n\n8. It maintains the fluent interface design by returning `Scenery` from most methods.\n\nYou can use this class in a fluent manner like this:\n\n```csharp\nvar world = new World();\nvar room = new Room(world, \"Living Room\");\nvar painting = new Scenery(world, \"Painting\")\n    .SetDescription(\"A beautiful landscape painting.\")\n    .SetExaminable(true)\n    .AddToRoom(room);\n```\n\nThis implementation ensures that Scenery objects behave appropriately within the world model, being fixed in place but examinable, and integrating well with the existing Room and Thing classes.",
