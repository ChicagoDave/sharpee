It inherits from Thing, but specializes its behavior.\n2. It's created with a type of \"scenery\".\n3. By default, it's not movable (`movable` is set to false) but is examinable (`examinable` is set to true).\n4. It has methods to set and get a description, which is common for scenery objects in IF games.\n5. It overrides the movement methods (`AddToContainer`, `RemoveFromContainer`, and `MoveTo`) to prevent the scenery from being moved, except when initially placing it in a room.\n6. It adds a `PlaceIn` method specifically for putting the scenery in a room, which is more semantically appropriate for scenery.\n7. It provides a `GetLocation` method to find out which room the scenery is in.\n\nThis implementation allows for fluent usage, such as:\n\n```csharp\nvar world = new World();\nvar room = new Room(world, \"Living Room\");\nvar painting = new Scenery(world, \"Painting\")\n    .SetDescription(\"A beautiful landscape painting.\")\n    .PlaceIn(room);\n\n// Later in the game logic:\nif (painting.IsExaminable)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(painting.GetDescription());\n}\n\n// This would throw an InvalidOperationException:\n// painting.MoveTo(new Room(world, \"Bedroom\"));\n```\n\nThis design ensures that scenery behaves appropriately within the IF world model, being fixed in place but describable and examinable.",
