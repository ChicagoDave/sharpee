      "text": " You're absolutely right, and I apologize for that oversight. The `_world` field is private in the `Thing` class and not accessible in the `Room` class. Let's revise the `Room` class to work around this limitation. We'll need to modify the `Thing` class slightly and then adjust the `Room` class accordingly.\n\nFirst, let's update the `Thing` class:\n\n```csharp\npublic class Thing\n{\n    protected readonly World _world;  // Changed to protected\n    protected readonly string _id;    // Changed to protected\n\n    // ... rest of the class remains the same ...\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's revise the `Room` class:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing DataStore;\n\nnamespace IFWorldModel\n{\n    public class Room : Thing\n    {\n        public Room(World world, string name) : base(world, name, \"room\")\n        {\n        }\n\n        public Room SetDescription(string description)\n        {\n            return (Room)SetProperty(\"description\", description);\n        }\n\n        public string GetDescription()\n        {\n            return GetProperty<string>(\"description\");\n        }\n\n        public Room AddExit(string direction, Room destination)\n        {\n            _world.ConnectNodesById(_id, destination._id, direction, GetReverseDirection(direction));\n            return this;\n        }\n\n        public Room RemoveExit(string direction)\n        {\n            var exitEdge = _world.Nodes[_id].Edges.FirstOrDefault(e => e.EdgeType == direction);\n            if (exitEdge != null)\n            {\n                _world.DisconnectNodesById(_id, exitEdge.Id2);\n            }\n            return this;\n        }\n\n        public IEnumerable<(string Direction, Room Destination)> GetExits()\n        {\n            return _world.Nodes[_id].Edges\n                .Where(e => IsDirectionEdge(e.EdgeType))\n                .Select(e => (e.EdgeType, new Room(_world, e.Id2)));\n        }\n\n        public Room GetExit(string direction)\n        {\n            var exitEdge = _world.Nodes[_id].Edges.FirstOrDefault(e => e.EdgeType == direction);\n            return exitEdge != null ? new Room(_world, exitEdge.Id2) : null;\n        }\n\n        private static bool IsDirectionEdge(string edgeType)\n        {\n            return new[] { \"north\", \"south\", \"east\", \"west\", \"northeast\", \"northwest\", \"southeast\", \"southwest\", \"up\", \"down\" }\n                .Contains(edgeType.ToLower());\n        }\n\n        private static string GetReverseDirection(string direction)\n        {\n            return direction.ToLower() switch\n            {\n                \"north\" => \"south\",\n                \"south\" => \"north\",\n                \"east\" => \"west\",\n                \"west\" => \"east\",\n                \"northeast\" => \"southwest\",\n                \"northwest\" => \"southeast\",\n                \"southeast\" => \"northwest\",\n                \"southwest\" => \"northeast\",\n                \"up\" => \"down\",\n                \"down\" => \"up\",\n                _ => throw new ArgumentException(\"Invalid direction\", nameof(direction)),\n            };\n        }\n\n        public new IEnumerable<Thing> Contents()\n        {\n            return base.Contents().Where(t => !(t is Room));\n        }\n\n        protected Room(World world, string id) : base(world, id)\n        {\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThese changes allow the `Room` class to access the `_world` and `_id` fields from the `Thing` class. The functionality remains the same, but now it properly inherits and uses the protected fields from the base class.\n\nThank you for catching that error. This revised version should work correctly within the inheritance structure we've set up. Let me know if you need any further clarification or if you're ready to move on to the next class.",
