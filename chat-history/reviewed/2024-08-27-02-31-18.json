The project aims to create a flexible framework for creating parser-based text adventures while incorporating modern software design principles and patterns.\n\n## Core Components\n\n### 1. World Model\n\nThe World Model serves as the central data structure for the IF engine. It's implemented using an in-memory graph data store, which provides flexibility in representing complex relationships between game objects.\n\nKey features:\n- Utilizes a `Graph` class to manage nodes (game objects) and edges (relationships)\n- Implements a `Thing` base class for all game objects, including rooms, items, and characters\n- Uses a property-based system for object attributes, allowing for easy extension\n\n### 2. Parser\n\nThe Parser component is responsible for interpreting user input and converting it into actionable game commands.\n\nKey features:\n- Tokenizes user input\n- Matches input against predefined verb patterns\n- Supports complex grammar structures, including multi-word objects and prepositions\n\n### 3. Action System\n\nThe Action System executes game commands based on the parsed user input.\n\nKey features:\n- Implements an `IActionHandler` interface for all action handlers\n- Uses an `ActionExecutor` to manage and dispatch actions\n- Supports custom action handlers for game-specific commands\n\n### 4. Story Runner\n\nThe Story Runner orchestrates the game loop, managing user input, parsing, action execution, and output.\n\nKey features:\n- Initializes the game world and components\n- Manages the main game loop\n- Handles game state changes and ending conditions\n\n## Design Patterns and Principles\n\n1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: The codebase is structured around core domain concepts like `Thing`, `Room`, and `Person`, reflecting the language of Interactive Fiction.\n\n2. **SOLID Principles**: \n   - Single Responsibility Principle: Each class has a clear, focused purpose.\n   - Open/Closed Principle: The system is designed for extension without modification.\n   - Liskov Substitution Principle: Subclasses like `Room` and `Person` can be used interchangeably with their base class `Thing`.\n   - Interface Segregation: Interfaces like `IActionHandler` are focused and specific.\n   - Dependency Inversion: High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.\n\n3. **Factory Pattern**: Used in the `WorldModel` class for creating game objects.\n\n4. **Observer Pattern**: Implemented for tracking changes in the game world.\n\n5. **Strategy Pattern**: Used in the Action System, allowing for easy addition of new game actions.\n\n## Language and Internationalization\n\nThe engine supports multiple languages through a robust internationalization system:\n\n- Implements a `LanguageManager` for managing text resources\n- Uses language-specific classes (e.g., `EnglishUS`) for storing text constants\n- Supports easy addition of new languages\n\n## Progress and Improvements\n\n1. **Initial Framework**: \n   - Basic `WorldModel` with `Thing`, `Room`, and `Person` classes\n   - Simple parser for basic commands\n\n2. **Enhanced World Model**:\n   - Introduced graph-based data structure for more complex object relationships\n   - Implemented a flexible property system for game objects\n\n3. **Advanced Parser**:\n   - Developed a more sophisticated parser supporting complex grammar structures\n   - Introduced the concept of \"scope\" for contextual parsing\n\n4. **Robust Action System**:\n   - Implemented the `IActionHandler` interface and `ActionExecutor`\n   - Added support for custom game-specific actions\n\n5. **Internationalization**:\n   - Developed the `LanguageManager` for multi-language support\n   - Refactored text constants into language-specific classes\n\n6. **Story Framework**:\n   - Created the `IStory` interface for defining game-specific logic\n   - Implemented the `StoryRunner` for managing the game loop\n\n7. **Testing and Quality Assurance**:\n   - Introduced unit tests for core components\n   - Implemented the \"Cloak of Darkness\" demo game to validate the engine's capabilities\n\n## Future Directions\n\n1. **Persistent Storage**: Implement save/load functionality for game states.\n2. **Natural Language Processing**: Enhance the parser with more advanced NLP techniques.\n3. **Scripting Support**: Add a scripting engine for more complex game logic.\n4. **GUI Integration**: Develop interfaces for creating hybrid text/graphical games.\n5. **Content Management**: Create tools for authors to easily create and manage game content.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Interactive Fiction engine has evolved from a basic text adventure framework to a sophisticated, extensible system capable of supporting complex narrative games. By adhering to solid software design principles and continuously refining core components, the engine provides a robust foundation for creating modern Interactive Fiction experiences.\n\n</antArtifact>\n\nThis white paper provides a comprehensive overview of the progress made in developing the Interactive Fiction engine. It highlights the key components, design decisions, and improvements over time. The document is structured to give readers a clear understanding of the engine's architecture, its evolution, and potential future directions.",
