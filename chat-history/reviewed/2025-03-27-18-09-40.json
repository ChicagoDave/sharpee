      "text": " I'll help you review the state of the Sharpee project and provide an updated checklist. Let's analyze where we stand based on the files you've shared.\n\n## Current State of Sharpee\n\nFrom reviewing the source files, I can see you've made significant progress on the foundational aspects of the engine:\n\n### Implemented Components\n\n1. **Core World Model** - The foundation is well-established with:\n   - Immutable state tree for managing game state\n   - Entity system with attributes and relationships\n   - Event system for state changes and notifications\n   - Query engine for finding entities and relationships\n   - Extension framework for modular components\n\n2. **Grammar System** - You've started building language processing components:\n   - Token and phrase definitions\n   - Part-of-speech tagging\n   - Command pattern matching\n   - English-specific grammar implementation with extensibility\n\n### Partially Implemented\n\n1. **Parser** - Basic structures defined but needs integration with world model\n2. **Command Processing** - Framework outlined but needs concrete implementations\n3. **Extension Architecture** - Base definitions exist but needs more hook points\n\n### Not Yet Implemented\n\n1. **Text Generation System** - For creating responses to player actions\n2. **Standard Actions Library** - Common IF actions (take, drop, look, etc.)\n3. **Story Definition Format** - Author-friendly way to define game content\n4. **Web Implementation** - React components and integration\n5. **Testing Framework** - Unit and integration tests\n\n## Updated Checklist\n\nBased on your progress, here's a recommended checklist for moving forward:\n\n### 1. Parser Integration (High Priority)\n- [  ] Connect grammar/parser to world model\n- [  ] Implement command disambiguation system\n- [  ] Add context-aware parsing (using world state)\n- [  ] Create parser extension points for story-specific commands\n\n### 2. Action System (High Priority)\n- [  ] Define standard action interface\n- [  ] Implement core IF actions (look, take, drop, inventory)\n- [  ] Create action precondition and post-condition framework\n- [  ] Build action failure handling system\n\n### 3. Text Generation (High Priority)\n- [  ] Create response template system\n- [  ] Implement variable substitution in responses\n- [  ] Add conditional text generation based on world state\n- [  ] Build proper handling of articles, pronouns, etc.\n\n### 4. Author API (Medium Priority)\n- [  ] Design fluent interface for story definition\n- [  ] Create helper functions for common world-building tasks\n- [  ] Implement story initialization system\n- [  ] Build validators for story consistency\n\n### 5. Web Implementation (Medium Priority)\n- [  ] Create React component for game display\n- [  ] Implement input/output handling\n- [  ] Add support for styling and theming\n- [  ] Build save/load functionality\n\n### 6. Testing Framework (Medium Priority)\n- [  ] Set up Jest for unit testing\n- [  ] Create test utilities for world model\n- [  ] Implement parser test helpers\n- [  ] Add integration tests for end-to-end flows\n\n### 7. Documentation (Low Priority)\n- [  ] Document core APIs\n- [  ] Create tutorials for authors\n- [  ] Add examples for common patterns\n- [  ] Create TypeDoc documentation\n\n### 8. Story-Specific Components (Low Priority)\n- [  ] Design \"Reflections\" components as example\n- [  ] Implement mirror/portal extension\n- [  ] Create character switching mechanism\n- [  ] Build branching narrative framework\n\n## Directory Structure Recommendation\n\n```\n/sharpee\n  /packages\n    /core\n      /src\n        /world-model\n          /types\n          /implementations\n        /parser\n        /actions\n        /text-gen\n        /extensions\n      /test\n    /web-client\n      /src\n        /components\n        /hooks\n        /utils\n      /test\n    /cli-client\n    /language-en\n    /examples\n      /reflections\n  /docs\n  /scripts\n```\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific area of the checklist or provide more detailed implementation guidance for any particular component?",
