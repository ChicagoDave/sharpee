Here's a breakdown of the key components:\n\n1. `EventType` enum: Defines different types of events that can occur in the story.\n\n2. `StoryEvent` class: Represents an individual event with properties like Id, Type, Timestamp, and a dictionary for additional data.\n\n3. `EventSource` class: The main class that manages the collection of events and provides methods to add, retrieve, and clear events.\n\nKey features of the `EventSource` class:\n\n- `AddEvent`: Adds a new event with the specified type and optional data.\n- `AddActionProcessedEvent`: A specialized method to add an event for processed actions, which includes the ParsedActionResult.\n- `GetEventsByType`: Retrieves events of a specific type.\n- `GetEventsSince`: Retrieves events that occurred after a specified timestamp.\n- `ClearEvents`: Clears all stored events.\n\nTo use this EventSource in your story implementation, you would create an instance of EventSource in your main story class and update it as actions are processed and game state changes. For example:\n\n```csharp\npublic class YourStory : IStory\n{\n    private EventSource _eventSource = new EventSource();\n\n    public ParsedActionResult ProcessAction(IParsedAction action)\n    {\n        var result = _actionExecutor.ExecuteAction(action, _playerId);\n        _eventSource.AddActionProcessedEvent(result);\n        // ... other processing ...\n        return result;\n    }\n\n    // ... other methods ...\n}\n```\n\nThis structure allows you to capture all significant events in your story, including processed actions, which can then be used by the TextService to generate appropriate output. It also provides a foundation for implementing more advanced features like replay, debugging, or analytics in the future.\n\nTo integrate this with a TextService, you would pass the EventSource to the TextService, allowing it to generate text based on the most recent events and the current game state.",
