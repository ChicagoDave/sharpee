The core goal was achieved - authors can now write `story.languageSet(US_EN)` and everything works. The failing `if-parser.test.ts` should now pass with built-in language support instead of external package dependencies.\nCurrent Status: Ready for Forge Layer Implementation ðŸš€\n**What's Working:**\n* âœ… New language system with `story.languageSet(US_EN)` API\n* âœ… Built-in English language definition (no external dependencies)\n* âœ… Story class with parser integration and message formatting\n* âœ… Updated parser tests using new language system\n* âœ… Clean, maintainable architecture in `packages/core/src/languages/`\n**Files Created/Modified:**\n* `packages/core/src/languages/` - Complete new language system\n* `packages/core/src/story/` - Story class with languageSet() method\n* Updated `if-parser.test.ts` to use built-in language system\n* Updated core exports to include new language and story modules\nNext Phase: Forge Layer Implementation\nBased on the project context, we're building **Sharpee** as an IF authoring platform with layers where \"the top author layer is implemented fluently.\" The forge layer should provide the high-level, fluent API that sits on top of the core world model and language system.\nKey Requirements for Forge Layer:\n1. **Fluent Author API** - Natural, readable syntax for non-programming authors\n2. **Built on Story Class** - Leverage the new `story.languageSet(US_EN)` foundation\n3. **IF-Agnostic World Model** - Use the existing core world model as the foundation\n4. **TypeScript Implementation** - Maintain type safety while providing fluent interface\n5. **Non-Programming Friendly** - Authors should focus on content, not code structure\nSuccess Criteria:\n* Authors can create IF stories using natural, fluent syntax\n* Integration with the new language system (story.languageSet())\n* Leverages existing IFWorld, parser, and event systems\n* Provides high-level abstractions over low-level core functionality\n* Maintains TypeScript benefits while hiding complexity\nPossible Forge API Vision:\n\n```\ntypescript\n```\n\n\n```typescript\nimport { forge, US_EN } from '@sharpee/core';\n\nconst story = forge()\n  .languageSet(US_EN)\n  .title(\"The Mysterious Key\")\n  .startIn(\"library\")\n  \n  .room(\"library\")\n    .description(\"A dusty old library with towering bookshelves.\")\n    .item(\"brass-key\").description(\"A small brass key\").takeable()\n    .exit(\"north\", \"hallway\")\n  \n  .room(\"hallway\") \n    .description(\"A long corridor with paintings on the walls.\")\n    .exit(\"south\", \"library\")\n  \n  .start();\n```\n\nYour Task:\n**Design and implement the Forge layer** that provides a fluent, author-friendly API on top of the existing Sharpee core systems. Focus on creating an intuitive interface that allows non-programming authors to create IF stories while leveraging all the robust functionality we've built in the core.\nConsider:\n* How should the fluent API be structured?\n* What are the most common IF authoring patterns to support?\n* How to integrate with the Story class and language system?\n* What abstractions make sense for rooms, items, NPCs, and interactions?\n* How to maintain the power of the underlying systems while simplifying the interface?\nPlease implement the Forge layer with examples showing how authors would use it to create IF stories.\n**Project Context Reminder:**\n* We're building Sharpee in TypeScript for IF authoring\n* Web implementation will be in React, but core should work with any client\n* We use Windows 11 and PowerShell\n* We write unit tests\n* The world-model is IF agnostic with IF things built on top\n* Author experience is paramount - \"always remain aware of how non-programming authors will work within it\"",
