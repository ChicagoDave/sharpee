Eventually there is a confrontation and they all realize the thief is the son-in-law of the old man and the young woman is the daughter of the thief.

      "text": " Thanks for sharing the Inform 7 extension! This \"Portals\" extension by Roger Carbol provides an excellent technical foundation for implementing the mirror mechanics in your game. Let me analyze how we can leverage this extension for your story and suggest specific implementation ideas.\n\n## Utilizing the Portals Extension\n\nThe extension already handles many of the core mechanics needed for your game:\n\n1. **Directing/Connecting Mirrors**: The extension's \"directing to\" and \"connection\" relations perfectly model how your characters establish paths between mirrors.\n\n2. **Mirror States**: Portals can be intact/broken, enterable/not enterable, and reach-enabled/reach-disabled - all useful for different mirror types and situations.\n\n3. **Sensing Nearby Portals**: The waving/divining actions will be perfect for characters detecting other mirrors.\n\n4. **Mirror Sizes**: The small/medium/large distinctions can represent different types of mirrors with varying capabilities.\n\n## Implementation Recommendations\n\n### Character-Specific Portal Properties\n\nFor each character, we can create specialized properties:\n\n```inform7\nA portal has a number called the silver-trace.\nA portal has a number called the time-since-use.\nA portal has a person called the last-user.\n\nAfter an actor going through a portal (called the gate):\n    now the last-user of the gate is the actor;\n    now the time-since-use of the gate is 0;\n    now the silver-trace of the gate is the silver-strength of the actor.\n```\n\n### Character Abilities\n\n```inform7\nA person has a number called silver-strength.\nA person has a number called silver-sensitivity.\nA person has a number called light-power.\nA person has a number called earth-connection.\n\nThe silver-strength of the thief is 3.\nThe silver-sensitivity of the old-man is 5.\nThe silver-strength of the young-woman is 3.\nThe light-power of the young-woman is 2.\n```\n\n### The Reflective Suit\n\n```inform7\nThe reflective-suit is a wearable thing.\nThe description is \"A full-body suit made of highly reflective material. It helps avoid detection by regular surveillance, but ironically makes you more visible to those with the Blood of Silver.\"\n\nAfter an actor going through a portal (called the gate) when the actor wears the reflective-suit:\n    increase the silver-trace of the gate by 3;\n    continue the action.\n```\n\n### Blood Powers Implementation\n\n#### Blood of the Silver\n```inform7\nUnderstanding \"sense [portal]\" as sensing.\nSensing is an action applying to one thing.\n\nCheck sensing:\n    if the noun is not a portal, say \"You can only sense mirrors.\" instead;\n    if the silver-sensitivity of the actor is less than 2, say \"Your connection to the Blood of Silver is too weak to sense traces.\" instead.\n\nCarry out sensing:\n    if the silver-trace of the noun is greater than 0:\n        say \"You sense that this mirror has been used recently[if the silver-trace of the noun is greater than 4]. The signature is unusually strong - perhaps someone wearing reflective material[end if].\";\n        if the silver-sensitivity of the actor is greater than 3 and the last-user of the noun is not nothing:\n            say \"You can sense that [the last-user of the noun] used this mirror.\";\n    otherwise:\n        say \"You detect no recent usage of this mirror.\"\n```\n\n#### Blood of the Moon (Invisibility)\n```inform7\nA person can be visible or invisible.\nA person is usually visible.\n\nBecoming-invisible is an action applying to nothing.\nUnderstand \"fade\" as becoming-invisible.\nUnderstand \"become invisible\" as becoming-invisible.\n\nCheck becoming-invisible:\n    if the actor does not have the blood-of-moon property, say \"You don't possess the Blood of the Moon.\" instead;\n    if the actor is invisible, say \"You are already invisible.\" instead.\n\nCarry out becoming-invisible:\n    now the actor is invisible;\n    now the actor is not described.\n\nReport becoming-invisible:\n    say \"You concentrate and feel your form fade from view.\"\n```\n\n#### Blood of Light (for Young Woman)\n```inform7\nCreating-light is an action applying to nothing.\nUnderstand \"illuminate\" as creating-light.\n\nCheck creating-light:\n    if the light-power of the actor is 0, say \"You don't possess the Blood of Light.\" instead.\n\nCarry out creating-light:\n    now the location is lighted.\n\nReport creating-light:\n    say \"You focus your energy, and a soft glow emanates from your fingertips, illuminating the area.\"\n```\n\n### Mirror Traps and Puzzle Implementation\n\nFor the adhesive trap puzzle:\n```inform7\nThe adhesive is a thing. \"A strong, sticky spray adhesive.\"\n\nSpraying it on is an action applying to one thing and one thing.\nUnderstand \"spray [something] on [something]\" as spraying it on.\n\nCarry out spraying the adhesive on a portal (called the target):\n    now the target is trapped.\n\nA portal can be trapped or untrapped. A portal is usually untrapped.\n\nCheck an actor going through a portal (called the gate):\n    if the gate is trapped:\n        if the actor is the player:\n            say \"As you attempt to pass through [the gate], you find yourself stuck in a sticky web of adhesive. You're trapped!\";\n            now the actor is stuck;\n            stop the action;\n        otherwise:\n            say \"[The actor] tries to pass through [the gate] but becomes trapped in adhesive!\";\n            now the actor is stuck;\n            stop the action.\n\nA person can be stuck or unstuck. A person is usually unstuck.\n```\n\n### Character Switching Mechanics\n\n```inform7\nThe current-pc is a person that varies. The current-pc is the thief.\n\nSwitching-to is an action applying to one visible thing.\nUnderstand \"switch to [someone]\" as switching-to.\n\nCarry out switching-to:\n    now the current-pc is the noun;\n    now the player is the noun;\n    try looking.\n\nEvery turn:\n    if the player is not the current-pc:\n        say \"*** The perspective shifts... ***\";\n        now the player is the current-pc;\n        try looking.\n```\n\n### Location-Based Automatic Switching\n\n```inform7\nAfter going to the Bank Safety Deposit Room:\n    if the player is the old-man and the thief is in the Safety Deposit Room:\n        say \"*** The perspective shifts to the thief... ***\";\n        now the current-pc is the thief;\n        now the player is the thief.\n\nAfter the old-man going to Hotel Room:\n    if the young-woman is nearby:\n        say \"*** The perspective shifts to the young woman... ***\";\n        now the current-pc is the young-woman;\n        now the player is the young-woman.\n```\n\n## Specific Puzzle Implementations\n\n### 1. The Art Gallery Heist\n\n```inform7\nThe security-system is a device in Art Gallery. The security-system can be triggered or untriggered. The security-system is untriggered.\n\nThe guard-patrol is a scene. The guard-patrol begins when the turn count is 3.

          "text": " Thanks for sharing the Inform 7 extension! This \"Portals\" extension by Roger Carbol provides an excellent technical foundation for implementing the mirror mechanics in your game. Let me analyze how we can leverage this extension for your story and suggest specific implementation ideas.\n\n## Utilizing the Portals Extension\n\nThe extension already handles many of the core mechanics needed for your game:\n\n1. **Directing/Connecting Mirrors**: The extension's \"directing to\" and \"connection\" relations perfectly model how your characters establish paths between mirrors.\n\n2. **Mirror States**: Portals can be intact/broken, enterable/not enterable, and reach-enabled/reach-disabled - all useful for different mirror types and situations.\n\n3. **Sensing Nearby Portals**: The waving/divining actions will be perfect for characters detecting other mirrors.\n\n4. **Mirror Sizes**: The small/medium/large distinctions can represent different types of mirrors with varying capabilities.\n\n## Implementation Recommendations\n\n### Character-Specific Portal Properties\n\nFor each character, we can create specialized properties:\n\n```inform7\nA portal has a number called the silver-trace.\nA portal has a number called the time-since-use.\nA portal has a person called the last-user.\n\nAfter an actor going through a portal (called the gate):\n    now the last-user of the gate is the actor;\n    now the time-since-use of the gate is 0;\n    now the silver-trace of the gate is the silver-strength of the actor.\n```\n\n### Character Abilities\n\n```inform7\nA person has a number called silver-strength.\nA person has a number called silver-sensitivity.\nA person has a number called light-power.\nA person has a number called earth-connection.\n\nThe silver-strength of the thief is 3.\nThe silver-sensitivity of the old-man is 5.\nThe silver-strength of the young-woman is 3.\nThe light-power of the young-woman is 2.\n```\n\n### The Reflective Suit\n\n```inform7\nThe reflective-suit is a wearable thing.\nThe description is \"A full-body suit made of highly reflective material. It helps avoid detection by regular surveillance, but ironically makes you more visible to those with the Blood of Silver.\"\n\nAfter an actor going through a portal (called the gate) when the actor wears the reflective-suit:\n    increase the silver-trace of the gate by 3;\n    continue the action.\n```\n\n### Blood Powers Implementation\n\n#### Blood of the Silver\n```inform7\nUnderstanding \"sense [portal]\" as sensing.\nSensing is an action applying to one thing.\n\nCheck sensing:\n    if the noun is not a portal, say \"You can only sense mirrors.\" instead;\n    if the silver-sensitivity of the actor is less than 2, say \"Your connection to the Blood of Silver is too weak to sense traces.\" instead.\n\nCarry out sensing:\n    if the silver-trace of the noun is greater than 0:\n        say \"You sense that this mirror has been used recently[if the silver-trace of the noun is greater than 4]. The signature is unusually strong - perhaps someone wearing reflective material[end if].\";\n        if the silver-sensitivity of the actor is greater than 3 and the last-user of the noun is not nothing:\n            say \"You can sense that [the last-user of the noun] used this mirror.\";\n    otherwise:\n        say \"You detect no recent usage of this mirror.\"\n```\n\n#### Blood of the Moon (Invisibility)\n```inform7\nA person can be visible or invisible.\nA person is usually visible.\n\nBecoming-invisible is an action applying to nothing.\nUnderstand \"fade\" as becoming-invisible.\nUnderstand \"become invisible\" as becoming-invisible.\n\nCheck becoming-invisible:\n    if the actor does not have the blood-of-moon property, say \"You don't possess the Blood of the Moon.\" instead;\n    if the actor is invisible, say \"You are already invisible.\" instead.\n\nCarry out becoming-invisible:\n    now the actor is invisible;\n    now the actor is not described.\n\nReport becoming-invisible:\n    say \"You concentrate and feel your form fade from view.\"\n```\n\n#### Blood of Light (for Young Woman)\n```inform7\nCreating-light is an action applying to nothing.\nUnderstand \"illuminate\" as creating-light.\n\nCheck creating-light:\n    if the light-power of the actor is 0, say \"You don't possess the Blood of Light.\" instead.\n\nCarry out creating-light:\n    now the location is lighted.\n\nReport creating-light:\n    say \"You focus your energy, and a soft glow emanates from your fingertips, illuminating the area.\"\n```\n\n### Mirror Traps and Puzzle Implementation\n\nFor the adhesive trap puzzle:\n```inform7\nThe adhesive is a thing. \"A strong, sticky spray adhesive.\"\n\nSpraying it on is an action applying to one thing and one thing.\nUnderstand \"spray [something] on [something]\" as spraying it on.\n\nCarry out spraying the adhesive on a portal (called the target):\n    now the target is trapped.\n\nA portal can be trapped or untrapped. A portal is usually untrapped.\n\nCheck an actor going through a portal (called the gate):\n    if the gate is trapped:\n        if the actor is the player:\n            say \"As you attempt to pass through [the gate], you find yourself stuck in a sticky web of adhesive. You're trapped!\";\n            now the actor is stuck;\n            stop the action;\n        otherwise:\n            say \"[The actor] tries to pass through [the gate] but becomes trapped in adhesive!\";\n            now the actor is stuck;\n            stop the action.\n\nA person can be stuck or unstuck. A person is usually unstuck.\n```\n\n### Character Switching Mechanics\n\n```inform7\nThe current-pc is a person that varies. The current-pc is the thief.\n\nSwitching-to is an action applying to one visible thing.\nUnderstand \"switch to [someone]\" as switching-to.\n\nCarry out switching-to:\n    now the current-pc is the noun;\n    now the player is the noun;\n    try looking.\n\nEvery turn:\n    if the player is not the current-pc:\n        say \"*** The perspective shifts... ***\";\n        now the player is the current-pc;\n        try looking.\n```\n\n### Location-Based Automatic Switching\n\n```inform7\nAfter going to the Bank Safety Deposit Room:\n    if the player is the old-man and the thief is in the Safety Deposit Room:\n        say \"*** The perspective shifts to the thief... ***\";\n        now the current-pc is the thief;\n        now the player is the thief.\n\nAfter the old-man going to Hotel Room:\n    if the young-woman is nearby:\n        say \"*** The perspective shifts to the young woman... ***\";\n        now the current-pc is the young-woman;\n        now the player is the young-woman.\n```\n\n## Specific Puzzle Implementations\n\n### 1. The Art Gallery Heist\n\n```inform7\nThe security-system is a device in Art Gallery. The security-system can be triggered or untriggered. The security-system is untriggered.\n\nThe guard-patrol is a scene. The guard-patrol begins when the turn count is 3.

I'll help you develop a comprehensive design document for your parser-based IF story based on the screenplay and backstory you've provided.\n\n# REFLECTIONS: Interactive Fiction Design Document\n\n## Description of the World\n\nIn our world, certain individuals possess supernatural abilities known as \"The Blood\" - hereditary powers passed down through bloodlines. These powers are named after elements (Silver, Moon, Earth, Light, etc.) and grant specific abilities. Those with these powers exist in a secretive society that has developed its own culture, traditions, and feuds over centuries.\n\n### People of this World\n\n- **The Blooded**: Individuals who possess supernatural abilities\n- **Silver Blooded**: Those with the ability to travel through mirrors and create connections between them\n- **Moon Blooded**: Those with the power of invisibility\n- **Earth Blooded**: The rarest bloodline, with powers of regeneration and communion with nature\n- **Light Blooded**: Those with abilities to manipulate light (rare)\n- **Regular Humans**: Unaware of the existence of the Blooded\n\n### Society of the Blooded\n\n- Secretive and insular, operating in hidden enclaves\n- Organized loosely by bloodlines with traditional alliances and rivalries\n- Maintain strict rules about exposure to regular humans\n- Possess their own justice system and customs for resolving disputes\n- Many believe certain bloodlines (like Earth and Light) have been eradicated in ancient feuds\n\n## The Powers (\"Blood of...\")\n\n- **Blood of the Silver**: \n  - Mirror travel and transportation\n  - Remote viewing through mirrors\n  - Sensing/tracking others who have used mirrors\n  - Creating permanent connections between mirrors\n\n- **Blood of the Moon**:\n  - Invisibility\n  - Enhanced stealth abilities\n  - Shadow manipulation\n\n- **Blood of the Earth**:\n  - Regeneration/healing\n  - Communication with natural elements\n  - Survival in harsh conditions\n\n- **Blood of the Light**:\n  - Light manipulation\n  - Illumination in darkness\n  - Creating illusions\n\n## Recent History\n\nTwenty years ago, the Thief (a Silver Blood) married Katherine (an Earth Blood, though neither knew of her ability). During a robbery gone wrong, Katherine was shot and appeared to die in the Thief's arms. Her father, the Old Man (also a Silver Blood), swore vengeance on the Thief, believing he had gotten his daughter killed. Unknown to both men, Katherine survived due to her dormant Earth Blood powers, crawled from her grave months later, and gave birth to a daughter, the Young Woman, who possesses both Silver and Earth Blood abilities.\n\n## Money\n\nThe Blooded use regular human currency but also have a system of favors and debts within their society. Certain services and information can only be obtained through these non-monetary exchanges.\n\n## Common Expressions/Colloquialisms\n\n- \"Through the glass\" - to travel via mirrors\n- \"Marking a mirror\" - leaving a trace for others to follow\n- \"Silver sight\" - the ability to detect other mirrors\n- \"The long reflection\" - death\n- \"Tracing blood\" - identifying someone's power lineage\n- \"Glass ties\" - connections between Blooded families\n\n## Prologue\n\nThe game opens with the Thief, in a state of depression over the loss of his wife two decades ago, executing an art heist at the Chicago Art Institute. Wearing a highly reflective suit (which ironically makes him more detectable to other Silver Bloods), he steals a valuable painting. Unknown to him, this act will bring him back into contact with his past and the family he thought was gone forever.\n\n## The Characters\n\n### The Player Characters\n\n#### The Thief\n- **Primary Ability**: Blood of the Silver (mirror travel)\n- **Personality**: Professional, methodical, haunted by past loss\n- **Objective**: Initially just stealing valuable items, later escaping the Old Man\n- **Special Equipment**: Reflective suit, portable \"escape mirror\"\n- **Relations**: Former son-in-law to the Old Man, father to the Young Woman\n\n#### The Old Man\n- **Primary Ability**: Blood of the Silver (with enhanced tracking)\n- **Personality**: Vengeful, determined, traditional\n- **Objective**: Kill the Thief to avenge his daughter\n- **Special Equipment**: Breaking baton, tracking tools\n- **Relations**: Father to Katherine, grandfather to the Young Woman\n\n#### The Young Woman\n- **Primary Abilities**: Blood of the Silver and dormant Blood of the Earth/Light\n- **Personality**: Curious, strategic, compassionate\n- **Objective**: Understand her heritage, prevent violence\n- **Special Equipment**: Family pendant with coat of arms\n- **Relations**: Daughter of the Thief and Katherine, granddaughter to the Old Man\n\n### Non-Player Characters\n\n#### Katherine\n- **Primary Ability**: Blood of the Earth\n- **Status**: Alive but hidden\n- **Relations**: Daughter of the Old Man, wife of the Thief, mother of the Young Woman\n\n#### The Madame\n- **Primary Ability**: Blood of the Silver\n- **Role**: Information broker within the Blooded community\n- **Location**: Runs the bordello which serves as a neutral ground\n\n## Story Synopsis\n\n### Chapter 1: The Heist (PC: The Thief)\nThe Thief, using his mirror-traveling abilities, breaks into the Chicago Art Institute and steals a valuable painting. The security system is triggered, forcing a hasty escape. Upon returning to his apartment, he discovers the painting has been stolen from him.\n\n### Chapter 2: The Hunter (PC: The Old Man)\nThe Old Man, having detected the Thief's activities through his distinctive reflective suit, follows his trail and steals the painting. He makes contact with the \"family\" (Blooded organization) to confirm his kill order on the Thief.\n\n### Chapter 3: The Observer (PC: The Young Woman)\nThe Young Woman has been watching both men, trying to understand their connection to her past. She follows the Old Man to a bordello that serves as a neutral ground for the Blooded and learns more about the feud between him and the Thief.\n\n### Chapter 4: On the Run (PC: The Thief)\nThe Thief realizes he's being hunted and attempts to secure resources by breaking into a bank vault. He sets traps using adhesive on mirrors to catch his pursuer.\n\n### Chapter 5: The Confrontation (PC: The Old Man)\nThe Old Man tracks the Thief to a hotel but falls into his trap, becoming stuck in the adhesive-covered mirror. He is captured by the Thief who questions him about his motives.\n\n### Chapter 6: The Revelation (PC: The Young Woman)\nThe Young Woman intervenes in the confrontation between the Thief and the Old Man. She reveals her identity as the daughter of both Katherine and the Thief, explaining that her mother survived and possesses the Blood of the Earth.\n\n### Chapter 7: Reunion or Tragedy (Multiple PCs)\nThe final chapter plays out differently based on player choices throughout the game. Optimal ending: the family reconciles and goes to find Katherine.

I'll help you develop a comprehensive design document for your parser-based IF story based on the screenplay and backstory you've provided.\n\n# REFLECTIONS: Interactive Fiction Design Document\n\n## Description of the World\n\nIn our world, certain individuals possess supernatural abilities known as \"The Blood\" - hereditary powers passed down through bloodlines. These powers are named after elements (Silver, Moon, Earth, Light, etc.) and grant specific abilities. Those with these powers exist in a secretive society that has developed its own culture, traditions, and feuds over centuries.\n\n### People of this World\n\n- **The Blooded**: Individuals who possess supernatural abilities\n- **Silver Blooded**: Those with the ability to travel through mirrors and create connections between them\n- **Moon Blooded**: Those with the power of invisibility\n- **Earth Blooded**: The rarest bloodline, with powers of regeneration and communion with nature\n- **Light Blooded**: Those with abilities to manipulate light (rare)\n- **Regular Humans**: Unaware of the existence of the Blooded\n\n### Society of the Blooded\n\n- Secretive and insular, operating in hidden enclaves\n- Organized loosely by bloodlines with traditional alliances and rivalries\n- Maintain strict rules about exposure to regular humans\n- Possess their own justice system and customs for resolving disputes\n- Many believe certain bloodlines (like Earth and Light) have been eradicated in ancient feuds\n\n## The Powers (\"Blood of...\")\n\n- **Blood of the Silver**: \n  - Mirror travel and transportation\n  - Remote viewing through mirrors\n  - Sensing/tracking others who have used mirrors\n  - Creating permanent connections between mirrors\n\n- **Blood of the Moon**:\n  - Invisibility\n  - Enhanced stealth abilities\n  - Shadow manipulation\n\n- **Blood of the Earth**:\n  - Regeneration/healing\n  - Communication with natural elements\n  - Survival in harsh conditions\n\n- **Blood of the Light**:\n  - Light manipulation\n  - Illumination in darkness\n  - Creating illusions\n\n## Recent History\n\nTwenty years ago, the Thief (a Silver Blood) married Katherine (an Earth Blood, though neither knew of her ability). During a robbery gone wrong, Katherine was shot and appeared to die in the Thief's arms. Her father, the Old Man (also a Silver Blood), swore vengeance on the Thief, believing he had gotten his daughter killed. Unknown to both men, Katherine survived due to her dormant Earth Blood powers, crawled from her grave months later, and gave birth to a daughter, the Young Woman, who possesses both Silver and Earth Blood abilities.\n\n## Money\n\nThe Blooded use regular human currency but also have a system of favors and debts within their society. Certain services and information can only be obtained through these non-monetary exchanges.\n\n## Common Expressions/Colloquialisms\n\n- \"Through the glass\" - to travel via mirrors\n- \"Marking a mirror\" - leaving a trace for others to follow\n- \"Silver sight\" - the ability to detect other mirrors\n- \"The long reflection\" - death\n- \"Tracing blood\" - identifying someone's power lineage\n- \"Glass ties\" - connections between Blooded families\n\n## Prologue\n\nThe game opens with the Thief, in a state of depression over the loss of his wife two decades ago, executing an art heist at the Chicago Art Institute. Wearing a highly reflective suit (which ironically makes him more detectable to other Silver Bloods), he steals a valuable painting. Unknown to him, this act will bring him back into contact with his past and the family he thought was gone forever.\n\n## The Characters\n\n### The Player Characters\n\n#### The Thief\n- **Primary Ability**: Blood of the Silver (mirror travel)\n- **Personality**: Professional, methodical, haunted by past loss\n- **Objective**: Initially just stealing valuable items, later escaping the Old Man\n- **Special Equipment**: Reflective suit, portable \"escape mirror\"\n- **Relations**: Former son-in-law to the Old Man, father to the Young Woman\n\n#### The Old Man\n- **Primary Ability**: Blood of the Silver (with enhanced tracking)\n- **Personality**: Vengeful, determined, traditional\n- **Objective**: Kill the Thief to avenge his daughter\n- **Special Equipment**: Breaking baton, tracking tools\n- **Relations**: Father to Katherine, grandfather to the Young Woman\n\n#### The Young Woman\n- **Primary Abilities**: Blood of the Silver and dormant Blood of the Earth/Light\n- **Personality**: Curious, strategic, compassionate\n- **Objective**: Understand her heritage, prevent violence\n- **Special Equipment**: Family pendant with coat of arms\n- **Relations**: Daughter of the Thief and Katherine, granddaughter to the Old Man\n\n### Non-Player Characters\n\n#### Katherine\n- **Primary Ability**: Blood of the Earth\n- **Status**: Alive but hidden\n- **Relations**: Daughter of the Old Man, wife of the Thief, mother of the Young Woman\n\n#### The Madame\n- **Primary Ability**: Blood of the Silver\n- **Role**: Information broker within the Blooded community\n- **Location**: Runs the bordello which serves as a neutral ground\n\n## Story Synopsis\n\n### Chapter 1: The Heist (PC: The Thief)\nThe Thief, using his mirror-traveling abilities, breaks into the Chicago Art Institute and steals a valuable painting.
