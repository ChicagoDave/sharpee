We've added methods to explicitly add and remove items from the scope (`AddToScope`, `RemoveFromScope`). These methods allow story authors to arbitrarily modify what's in scope.\n\n2. The `UpdateScope` method now uses these new methods, making it easier to understand and potentially override in derived classes.\n\n3. We've added a `ClearScope` method to completely reset the scope if needed.\n\n4. The `GetAllInScopeItems` method allows retrieving all items currently in scope, which can be useful for debugging or for implementing more complex scope-related logic in the story.\n\n5. We're now using a `HashSet<Thing>` for `_inScopeItems`, which provides better performance for add, remove, and lookup operations.\n\nThese changes give story authors much more flexibility in controlling what's in scope. They can now:\n\n- Add items to the scope that aren't physically present in the room or inventory (e.g., for omnipresent objects or abstract concepts).\n- Remove items from scope even if they would normally be in scope (e.g., to implement invisibility or hiding mechanics).\n- Completely clear and rebuild the scope as needed for special game states.\n\nTo use this in a story class, you might do something like:\n\n```csharp\npublic class MyStory : IStory\n{\n    private Scope _scope;\n    \n    // ... other methods ...\n\n    public void Initialize()\n    {\n        // ... other initialization ...\n        _scope = new Scope(_worldModel, _playerId);\n        \n        // Add a special item to scope that's always available\n        var magicAmulet = _worldModel.CreateThing(\"Magic Amulet\", \"A mysterious amulet that's always with you.\");\n        _scope.AddToScope(magicAmulet);\n    }\n\n    public ParsedActionResult ProcessAction(ParsedAction action)\n    {\n        // ... process the action ...\n\n        // After processing, update the scope\n        _scope.UpdateScope();\n\n        // Maybe add or remove things based on game state\n        if (gameState.IsNightTime)\n        {\n            var moon = _worldModel.CreateThing(\"Moon\", \"A bright full moon in the night sky.\");\n            _scope.AddToScope(moon);\n        }\n\n        return result;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis new implementation provides a good balance between automatic scope management (through `UpdateScope`) and manual control (through the new add and remove methods), giving story authors the flexibility they need to create more complex and interesting game mechanics.",

We should update the `Scope` class to allow for arbitrary additions of items, which will give story authors more control over what's considered \"in scope\" at any given time.\n\nLet's update the `Scope` class to accommodate this requirement. Here's a proposed revision:\n\n<antThinking>This update to the Scope class is substantial and self-contained. It's likely that users might want to modify or extend this class further. Therefore, it's a good candidate for an artifact.</antThinking>\n\n<antArtifact identifier=\"updated-scope-class\" type=\"application/vnd.ant.code\" language=\"csharp\" title=\"Updated Scope Class\">\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing IFWorldModel;\n\nnamespace ParserLibrary\n{\n    public class Scope\n    {\n        private readonly WorldModel _worldModel;\n        private readonly Guid _playerId;\n        private readonly HashSet<Thing> _inScopeItems = new HashSet<Thing>();\n\n        public Scope(WorldModel worldModel, Guid playerId)\n        {\n            _worldModel = worldModel ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(worldModel));\n            _playerId = playerId;\n            UpdateScope();\n        }\n\n        public void UpdateScope()\n        {\n            _inScopeItems.Clear();\n\n            var playerLocation = _worldModel.GetPlayerLocation(_playerId);\n            if (playerLocation != null)\n            {\n                AddToScope(_worldModel.GetRoomContents(playerLocation));\n                AddToScope(_worldModel.GetPlayerItems(_playerId));\n            }\n        }\n\n        public void AddToScope(Thing item)\n        {\n            _inScopeItems.Add(item);\n        }\n\n        public void AddToScope(IEnumerable<Thing> items)\n        {\n            _inScopeItems.UnionWith(items);\n        }\n\n        public void RemoveFromScope(Thing item)\n        {\n            _inScopeItems.Remove(item);\n        }\n\n        public void RemoveFromScope(IEnumerable<Thing> items)\n        {\n            _inScopeItems.ExceptWith(items);\n        }\n\n        public bool IsInScope(string itemName)\n        {\n            return _inScopeItems.Any(item => item.Name.Equals(itemName, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));\n        }\n\n        public Thing GetInScopeItem(string itemName)\n        {\n            return _inScopeItems.FirstOrDefault(item => item.Name.Equals(itemName, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));\n        }\n\n        public IEnumerable<Thing> GetAllInScopeItems()\n        {\n            return _inScopeItems.ToList();\n        }\n\n        public void ClearScope()\n        {\n            _inScopeItems.Clear();\n        }\n    }\n}\n</antArtifact>\n\nThis updated `Scope` class provides several improvements:\n\n1. We've added methods to explicitly add and remove items from the scope (`AddToScope`, `RemoveFromScope`). These methods allow story authors to arbitrarily modify what's in scope.\n\n2. The `UpdateScope` method now uses these new methods, making it easier to understand and potentially override in derived classes.\n\n3. We've added a `ClearScope` method to completely reset the scope if needed.\n\n4. The `GetAllInScopeItems` method allows retrieving all items currently in scope, which can be useful for debugging or for implementing more complex scope-related logic in the story.\n\n5. We're now using a `HashSet<Thing>` for `_inScopeItems`, which provides better performance for add, remove, and lookup operations.\n\nThese changes give story authors much more flexibility in controlling what's in scope. They can now:\n\n- Add items to the scope that aren't physically present in the room or inventory (e.g., for omnipresent objects or abstract concepts).\n- Remove items from scope even if they would normally be in scope (e.g., to implement invisibility or hiding mechanics).\n- Completely clear and rebuild the scope as needed for special game states.\n\nTo use this in a story class, you might do something like:\n\n```csharp\npublic class MyStory : IStory\n{\n    private Scope _scope;\n    \n    // ... other methods ...\n\n    public void Initialize()\n    {\n        // ... other initialization ...\n        _scope = new Scope(_worldModel, _playerId);\n        \n        // Add a special item to scope that's always available\n        var magicAmulet = _worldModel.CreateThing(\"Magic Amulet\", \"A mysterious amulet that's always with you.\");\n        _scope.AddToScope(magicAmulet);\n    }\n\n    public ParsedActionResult ProcessAction(ParsedAction action)\n    {\n        // ... process the action ...\n\n        // After processing, update the scope\n        _scope.UpdateScope();\n\n        // Maybe add or remove things based on game state\n        if (gameState.IsNightTime)\n        {\n            var moon = _worldModel.CreateThing(\"Moon\", \"A bright full moon in the night sky.\");\n            _scope.AddToScope(moon);\n        }\n\n        return result;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis new implementation provides a good balance between automatic scope management (through `UpdateScope`) and manual control (through the new add and remove methods), giving story authors the flexibility they need to create more complex and interesting game mechanics.",
