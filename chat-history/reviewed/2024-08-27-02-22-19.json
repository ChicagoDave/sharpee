We've added a new field `private readonly TextService _textService;` and initialized it in the constructor. This allows us to use the TextService throughout the StoryRunner.\n\n2. In the `Run` method, we've replaced direct Console.WriteLine calls with calls to `_textService.GetActionResultText(...)`. This change ensures that all our output is consistently formatted through the TextService.\n\n3. We're now passing the entire `parseResult.Results` and `actionResult.Results` to the TextService, rather than just getting a single message. This allows the TextService to handle multiple results and format them appropriately.\n\n4. We've kept the game over message as a direct call to `LanguageManager.GetText(...)` because it's a single, simple message that doesn't require the full formatting capabilities of the TextService.\n\nThese changes provide several benefits:\n\n1. Consistency: All action results are now formatted through the TextService, ensuring consistent output formatting throughout the game.\n\n2. Flexibility: The TextService can handle multiple results and apply any necessary formatting or localization.\n\n3. Separation of concerns: The StoryRunner is no longer responsible for formatting output. This responsibility has been moved to the TextService, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.\n\n4. Future-proofing: If we need to change how results are displayed in the future (e.g., adding color, changing formatting), we only need to modify the TextService, not the StoryRunner.\n\nTo fully implement this change, you might need to update other parts of your code to ensure that all relevant information is included in the ActionResults. For example, the LookAction might need to include room descriptions, item lists, and exit information as separate ActionResults, rather than combining them into a single message.",
