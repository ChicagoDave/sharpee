      "text": " The error you're encountering is because `LanguageManager.GetText(string)` is likely a static method, but it's being called as if it were an instance method. To resolve this, you need to call the method using the class name rather than an instance.\n\nLet's take a look at how to fix this:\n\n1. First, make sure that the `GetText` method in `LanguageManager` is indeed static. It should be defined like this:\n\n```csharp\npublic static class LanguageManager\n{\n    public static string GetText(string key)\n    {\n        // Method implementation\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. Then, in your `TextService.cs` file, change how you're calling the method. Instead of:\n\n```csharp\n_languageManager.GetText(key)\n```\n\nUse:\n\n```csharp\nLanguageManager.GetText(key)\n```\n\nHere's an example of how the corrected code might look:\n\n```csharp\npublic class TextService : ITextService\n{\n    public string GetText(string key)\n    {\n        return LanguageManager.GetText(key);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis change should resolve the CS0176 error. The error was occurring because you were trying to access a static method (`GetText`) as if it were an instance method. By calling it on the class name (`LanguageManager`) instead of an instance (`_languageManager`), you're correctly accessing the static method.\n\nIf you had intended for `LanguageManager` to be instantiated and `GetText` to be an instance method, you would need to change the `LanguageManager` class and `GetText` method to be non-static. However, given the typical usage of language managers in games, it's more common and usually more appropriate for these to be static.",
