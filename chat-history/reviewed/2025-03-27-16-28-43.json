Let's organize this approach to ensure we're addressing both the story elements and the technical implementation needs.\n\n## Story Structure for Reflections\n\nBased on your screenplay and design documents, here's how we might structure the interactive fiction:\n\n### Character Development\n- **The Thief**: Develop his grief and isolation over the past 20 years, his professional detachment as a thief, and his emotional awakening when he discovers the truth\n- **The Old Man**: Show his transformation from vengeful hunter to grandfather, with complex feelings about having pursued his son-in-law for decades\n- **The Young Woman**: Build her journey of discovery as she pieces together her family history and identity\n\n### Key Puzzles\n1. **Mirror Network Puzzles**: \n   - Creating connections between mirrors\n   - Finding \"safe\" mirrors not monitored by The Family\n   - Repairing broken mirrors\n\n2. **Stealth Puzzles**:\n   - Timing guard patterns during heists\n   - Tracking without being tracked\n   - Using invisibility (when playing as characters with that ability)\n\n3. **Identity Puzzles**:\n   - Gathering evidence about bloodline connections\n   - Deciphering family histories\n   - Finding proof of Katherine's survival\n\n### Story Structure\n- **Prologue**: The art heist (playing as The Thief)\n- **Act 1**: The discovery of other mirror travelers (alternating between characters)\n- **Act 2**: The confrontation and capture (climaxing with The Old Man's capture)\n- **Act 3**: Revelations and reunion/tragedy (multiple possible endings)\n\n## Technical Implementation Plan\n\n### Directory Structure\n```\nsharpee/\n├── packages/\n│   ├── core/              # Core engine\n│   │   ├── src/\n│   │   │   ├── parser/    # Natural language parsing\n│   │   │   ├── world/     # World model\n│   │   │   ├── state/     # State management \n│   │   │   └── grammar/   # Text generation\n│   │   └── tests/\n│   ├── extensions/\n│   │   ├── mirrors/       # Mirror portal functionality\n│   │   ├── characters/    # Character switching\n│   │   └── abilities/     # Blood powers\n│   ├── standard-library/  # Common IF behaviors\n│   │   ├── physical/      # Physical model (rooms, objects)\n│   │   ├── actions/       # Standard actions\n│   │   └── characters/    # NPC behaviors\n│   ├── cli/               # Command line tools\n│   └── web/               # React web implementation\n│       ├── components/\n│       ├── hooks/\n│       └── state/\n├── stories/\n│   └── reflections/       # The Reflections story\n│       ├── chapters/\n│       ├── characters/\n│       ├── locations/\n│       └── items/\n└── tools/                 # Development tools\n    ├── validator/\n    ├── visualizer/\n    └── test-runner/\n```\n\n### Implementation Priorities\n\n1. **Core Engine First**:\n   - Implement basic state management\n   - Create simple parser\n   - Build fundamental world model\n   - Develop grammar generation system\n\n2. **Mirror Extension**:\n   - Implement mirror connections\n   - Create portal functionality\n   - Build sensing/detection\n\n3. **Character System**:\n   - Character switching mechanism\n   - Viewpoint management\n   - Inventory and abilities\n\n4. **Story Implementation**:\n   - Define locations\n   - Create characters\n   - Implement puzzles\n   - Build multiple ending paths\n\n### Key Technical Challenges\n\n1. **Mirror System Implementation**:\n   - Representing connections between mirrors\n   - Remote viewing through mirrors\n   - Tracking mirror usage for detection\n\n2. **Character Switching**:\n   - Managing state across different player characters\n   - Ensuring consistent world state\n   - Handling different abilities\n\n3. **Blood Powers**:\n   - Implementing different abilities (Silver, Earth, Moon, Light)\n   - Creating consistent rules for power usage\n   - Balancing powers for puzzle design\n\n4. **Narrative Branching**:\n   - Managing conditional story progression\n   - Tracking key decisions\n   - Implementing multiple endings\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Core Engine Development**:\n   - Build state management system (immutable state tree)\n   - Implement basic parser\n   - Create fundamental world model\n\n2. **Mirror Extension Prototype**:\n   - Develop mirror connection system\n   - Test portal functionality\n   - Implement remote viewing\n\n3. **Basic Story Structure**:\n   - Define key locations\n   - Create main character profiles\n   - Outline puzzle dependencies\n\n4. **Web Client Foundation**:\n   - Set up React component architecture\n   - Create state management hooks\n   - Build basic UI elements\n\nWould you like me to focus on any specific aspect of this outline?
