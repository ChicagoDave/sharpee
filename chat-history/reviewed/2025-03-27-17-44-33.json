Let's start by analyzing where we stand with both projects.\n\n## Reflections Story Status\n\nBased on the documents you've shared, you have:\n- A detailed screenplay (reflections screenplay.txt)\n- Background story (Reflections-back story.txt)\n- A comprehensive design document (reflections-design.md)\n\nThe story concept is strong - it centers around characters with supernatural mirror-traveling abilities (\"Blood of the Silver\") and other powers, with a family mystery at its core. The three main characters (The Thief, The Old Man, and The Young Woman) have interconnected backstories, and players will play as each of them at different points.\n\n## Sharpee Development Status\n\nFor the Sharpee implementation, you've shared:\n- A checklist of requirements (check list.md)\n- TypeScript implementation files for the core engine\n- Design notes on the architecture (sharpee-ts.md)\n\nThe code shows a well-structured entity-component system with:\n- Immutable state management\n- Event emitter system\n- Query engine for finding entities\n- Entity manager for creating/updating entities\n- Relationship management between entities\n\n## Recommendations for Reflections Story Implementation\n\n1. **Character Perspective Switching:**\n   - Implement clear transitions between character perspectives\n   - Ensure each character has a distinct \"voice\" and abilities\n   - Track knowledge state per character (what each knows about the others)\n\n2. **Mirror Mechanics:**\n   - Define clear rules for how mirrors connect and work\n   - Create puzzles that leverage the unique mirror travel mechanics\n   - Add mirror states (connected, broken, blocked)\n\n3. **Story Structure:**\n   - Use the 7-chapter structure outlined in your design doc\n   - Create branching paths based on key decisions\n   - Implement multiple endings as outlined\n\n4. **Key Puzzles:**\n   - Mirror-based travel puzzles (finding the right mirrors)\n   - Stealth/timing puzzles (especially during heists)\n   - Information puzzles (discovering family connections)\n   - Trust-building puzzles (convincing characters of the truth)\n\n## Sharpee Implementation Progress\n\nLet's update the checklist based on what I can see in your code files:\n\n### Completed Items:\n- ✅ Immutable state tree implementation\n- ✅ Entity-component-system for game objects\n- ✅ Relationship tracking between objects\n- ✅ State update mechanism\n- ✅ History tracking and undo support\n- ✅ Event system for extension hooks\n\n### In Progress Items:\n- ⏳ Core Engine Components\n- ⏳ Extension Architecture\n- ⏳ Mirror Portal extension (for Reflections)\n\n### Still Needed:\n- ❌ Parser Library\n- ❌ Grammar Library\n- ❌ Standard Library for IF Physics\n- ❌ Character System\n- ❌ Development Tools\n- ❌ Author-friendly fluent API layer\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **For Reflections:**\n   - Start with location design - map out all the key locations and their connections\n   - Define the mirror network - which mirrors connect to where\n   - Create character ability specifications - exact rules for how powers work\n   - Design the first chapter's puzzles in detail\n\n2. **For Sharpee:**\n   - Implement the parser library for natural language input\n   - Create the grammar/text generation system\n   - Build the standard IF physics (rooms, containers, etc.)\n   - Develop the author-friendly API layer for non-programmers\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of either the story design or the Sharpee implementation? I can provide more detailed recommendations for puzzles, mirror mechanics, character abilities, or technical architecture.",
