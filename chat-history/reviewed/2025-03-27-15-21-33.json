Let's build a comprehensive plan based on the materials you've provided.\n\nFirst, let me analyze what you've shared:\n\n1. The screenplay provides the narrative framework with three main characters (The Thief, The Old Man, The Young Woman) connected by blood ties and mirror-travel abilities\n2. The backstory explains the \"Blood\" powers and family relationships\n3. The design document outlines the world, mechanics, and chapter structure\n4. The Portals extension demonstrates technical implementation of mirror travel in an IF system\n\nFrom your Sharpee project summary, I understand you want Reflections to be a reference story for this new TypeScript-based IF engine with immutable state trees and extensible architecture.\n\n## Story Structure Recommendations\n\nGiven Sharpee's architecture, I recommend structuring Reflections with:\n\n1. **Multiple Viewpoint Characters**: Leverage Sharpee's immutable state to allow players to experience the story from all three perspectives, with state changes persisting across viewpoint shifts\n\n2. **Mirror Network System**: Implement a robust mirror connection system that tracks:\n   - Discovered mirrors\n   - Created connections\n   - Mirror \"memory\"\n   - Traversal history\n\n3. **Chapter-Based Progression**: Organize the story in chapters that switch viewpoint characters at key moments, but allow optional exploration\n\n4. **Relationship State Tracking**: Track the evolving relationships between characters based on player choices\n\n## Key Technical Implementation Areas\n\nFor Reflections to showcase Sharpee's capabilities:\n\n1. **State Management**:\n   - Track mirror networks across character changes\n   - Persist world state (who has which items, which mirrors are connected)\n   - Record character knowledge separately from world state\n\n2. **Extension Architecture**:\n   - Create mirror-specific extensions to handle the portal mechanics\n   - Implement \"Blood\" powers as separate extension modules\n   - Build character-switching as a demonstration of state preservation\n\n3. **Performance Optimization**:\n   - Precompute mirror connection graphs\n   - Cache frequently accessed mirror states\n   - Optimize state updates for mirror networks\n\n## Puzzle Structure Suggestions\n\nTo showcase both the story and engine capabilities:\n\n1. **Mirror Network Puzzles**:\n   - Creating specific connection patterns between mirrors\n   - Using mirror connections to bypass physical obstacles\n   - Timing puzzles where mirrors are only temporarily accessible\n\n2. **Multi-Character Coordination**:\n   - Puzzles requiring information from one character to solve as another\n   - Moving objects between characters through strategic mirror placement\n   - Creating situations where character abilities complement each other\n\n3. **Emotional/Narrative Puzzles**:\n   - Dialogue choices affecting character relationships\n   - Memory puzzles revealing backstory elements\n   - Identity verification puzzles for the family reunion\n\nWould you like me to develop any specific aspect in more detail? I could focus on puzzle design, character development, mirror mechanics implementation, or the chapter structure.",
