Let's revisit the DataStore implementation and adjust our approach accordingly.\n\nLooking at the provided DataStore code, we have:\n\n```csharp\npublic class Graph\n{\n    private readonly Dictionary<Guid, INode> _nodes;\n    // ...\n}\n\npublic interface INode\n{\n    Guid Id { get; }\n    IDictionary<string, IProperty> Properties { get; }\n    List<IEdge> Edges { get; set; }\n    // ...\n}\n\npublic interface IEdge\n{\n    INode Source { get; }\n    INode Target { get; }\n    IDictionary<string, IProperty> SourceProperties { get; }\n    IDictionary<string, IProperty> TargetProperties { get; }\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nGiven this structure, let's revise the `GetRoomExits` method to align with the DataStore graph:\n\n```csharp\npublic IEnumerable<(string Direction, Room Destination)> GetRoomExits(Room room)\n{\n    if (room == null)\n        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(room));\n\n    return room.Edges\n        .Where(e => IsValidExit(e))\n        .Select(e => (\n            Direction: GetExitDirection(e),\n            Destination: GetExitDestination(room, e)\n        ))\n        .Where(exit => exit.Destination != null);\n}\n\nprivate bool IsValidExit(IEdge edge)\n{\n    if (edge.Target is Room)\n        return true;\n\n    if (edge.Target is Door door)\n        return door.IsOpen;\n\n    return false;\n}\n\nprivate string GetExitDirection(IEdge edge)\n{\n    return edge.SourceProperties.TryGetValue(\"Direction\", out var directionProperty)\n        ? directionProperty.GetValue<string>()\n        : null;\n}\n\nprivate Room GetExitDestination(Room sourceRoom, IEdge exit)\n{\n    if (exit.Target is Room room)\n        return room;\n\n    if (exit.Target is Door door && door.IsOpen)\n        return GetRoomBeyondDoor(sourceRoom, door);\n\n    return null;\n}\n\nprivate Room GetRoomBeyondDoor(Room currentRoom, Door door)\n{\n    return door.Edges\n        .Where(e => e.Target is Room && e.Target != currentRoom)\n        .Select(e => e.Target as Room)\n        .FirstOrDefault();\n}\n```\n\nThis revised implementation:\n\n1. Uses the `Edges` collection from the `INode` interface, which `Room` should implement.\n\n2. Accesses the direction using `edge.SourceProperties`, which aligns with the `IEdge` interface in the DataStore.\n\n3. Uses type checking (`is` keyword) to determine if the target is a `Room` or a `Door`, which is consistent with the graph structure where nodes can be of different types.\n\n4. Assumes that `Room` and `Door` classes inherit from a common base class or interface that implements `INode`.\n\n5. Uses the `GetValue<T>` method on properties, which should be provided by the `IProperty` interface in the DataStore.\n\nThis implementation now aligns more closely with the foundational DataStore graph structure. It uses the properties and methods provided by the `INode` and `IEdge` interfaces, and it respects the graph-based nature of the data store.\n\nTo ensure this works correctly:\n\n1. Make sure `Room` and `Door` classes implement the `INode` interface.\n2. Implement the `IsOpen` property in the `Door` class.\n3. Ensure that when creating exits, you're setting the \"Direction\" property on the edge's `SourceProperties`.\n\nThis approach should now be consistent with the DataStore graph structure while still providing the functionality to get valid exits from a room.",

Implements the GetRoomExits method as we discussed, considering both direct exits and exits through doors.\n6. Includes helper methods for determining valid exits and finding rooms beyond doors.\n\nThis implementation should be consistent with your graph-based model and provide the necessary functionality for managing the world state in your interactive fiction engine.

Method Chaining: Many methods now return `this` or a builder object, allowing for method chaining.\n\n2. Expressive API: The API is now more expressive, with methods like `CreateExit(Room, string).To(Room)` and `CreateDoor(string, string).Between(Room, string).And(Room, string)`.\n\n3. Builder Pattern: Introduced `ExitBuilder` and `DoorBuilder` classes to create more complex objects in a step-by-step manner.\n\n4. Simplified Creation: The `CreateThing` method now uses generics and returns the created object, allowing for immediate property setting.\n\n5. Concise Methods: Some methods have been simplified using expression-bodied members and more concise LINQ queries.\n\n6. Consistent Return Types: Methods that modify the world state return `WorldModel`, allowing for further chaining.\n\nThis design allows for more readable and expressive code when using the WorldModel. For example:\n\n```csharp\nworldModel\n    .CreateRoom(\"Living Room\", \"A cozy living room.\")\n    .CreateRoom(\"Kitchen\", \"A modern kitchen.\")\n    .CreateExit(\"Living Room\", \"north\").To(\"Kitchen\")\n    .CreateDoor(\"Cellar Door\", \"A heavy wooden door.\")\n        .Between(\"Living Room\", \"down\")\n        .And(\"Cellar\", \"up\")\n    .CreateThing(\"Book\", \"An old leather-bound book\")\n    .PlaceItem(\"Book\", \"Living Room\");\n```\n\nThis fluent design makes the API more intuitive and easier to use, while still maintaining the underlying graph-based structure of the world model.",

Simplified Creation: The `CreateThing` method now uses generics and returns the created object, allowing for immediate property setting.\n\n5. Concise Methods: Some methods have been simplified using expression-bodied members and more concise LINQ queries.\n\n6. Consistent Return Types: Methods that modify the world state return `WorldModel`, allowing for further chaining.\n\nThis design allows for more readable and expressive code when using the WorldModel. For example:\n\n```csharp\nworldModel\n    .CreateRoom(\"Living Room\", \"A cozy living room.\")\n    .CreateRoom(\"Kitchen\", \"A modern kitchen.\")\n    .CreateExit(\"Living Room\", \"north\").To(\"Kitchen\")\n    .CreateDoor(\"Cellar Door\", \"A heavy wooden door.\")\n        .Between(\"Living Room\", \"down\")\n        .And(\"Cellar\", \"up\")\n    .CreateThing(\"Book\", \"An old leather-bound book\")\n    .PlaceItem(\"Book\", \"Living Room\");\n```\n\nThis fluent design makes the API more intuitive and easier to use, while still maintaining the underlying graph-based structure of the world model.",

Let's modify the `CreateThing` method to accommodate this. We'll use a factory pattern instead of relying on a parameterless constructor. Here's the corrected version:\n\n```csharp\npublic class WorldModel\n{\n    // ... other code ...\n\n    public Thing CreateThing(string name, string description) => CreateThing<Thing>(name, description);\n\n    public T CreateThing<T>(string name, string description) where T : Thing\n    {\n        T thing;\n        if (typeof(T) == typeof(Thing))\n        {\n            thing = new Thing(name, description) as T;\n        }\n        else if (typeof(T) == typeof(Person))\n        {\n            thing = new Person(name, description) as T;\n        }\n        else if (typeof(T) == typeof(Door))\n        {\n            thing = new Door(name, description) as T;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            throw new ArgumentException($\"Unsupported type: {typeof(T).Name}\");\n        }\n\n        _graph.AddNode(thing);\n        return thing;\n    }\n\n    public Person CreatePerson(string name, string description)\n    {\n        return CreateThing<Person>(name, description);\n    }\n\n    // ... rest of the WorldModel class ...\n}\n```\n\nThis approach:\n\n1.
