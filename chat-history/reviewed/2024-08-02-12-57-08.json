      "text": " Thank you for providing the context and the code for review. After examining the DataStore implementation, there are a few inconsistencies and potential improvements that we can address:\n\n1. Inconsistent use of nullable reference types:\n   Some classes use nullable reference types (e.g., `IEdge` with `INode?`), while others don't. It would be more consistent to use nullable reference types throughout the codebase.\n\n2. Inconsistent property setters:\n   In the `Edge` class, `Source` and `Target` properties have private setters, while in the `IEdge` interface, they're read-only. This inconsistency could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n3. Lack of immutability for critical properties:\n   Consider making `Id` and `Type` properties readonly in the `Edge` class to ensure they can't be changed after initialization.\n\n4. Inconsistent error handling:\n   Some methods throw exceptions (e.g., `Graph.AddNode`), while others return null or empty collections (e.g., `Graph.GetAdjacentNodes`). A more consistent approach to error handling would improve the API.\n\n5. Potential for null reference exceptions:\n   Some methods, like `Edge.ConnectNodes`, don't check for null arguments, which could lead to null reference exceptions.\n\n6. Incomplete implementation of the observer pattern:\n   The `Graph` class implements the observer pattern, but there's no way to notify observers about property changes.\n\n7. Lack of generic type constraints:\n   The `GetPropertyValue<T>` method could benefit from generic type constraints to ensure type safety.\n\n8. Inconsistent method naming:\n   Some methods use verb-noun format (e.g., `RemoveEdge`), while others use noun-verb (e.g., `EdgeRemoved`). Consistent naming would improve readability.\n\n9. Potential performance issue in `Node.GetAdjacentNodes`:\n   This method concatenates two LINQ queries, which could be inefficient for large graphs. Consider using a `HashSet` for better performance.\n\n10. Lack of XML documentation:\n    Adding XML documentation to public methods and classes would improve the API's usability.\n\n11. Unused using statements:\n    Some files have unused using statements that could be removed.\n\n12. Inconsistent access modifiers:\n    Some classes use explicit `public` modifiers for interface implementations, while others don't. Consistency would improve readability.\n\nTo address these issues, we could make the following improvements:\n\n1. Use nullable reference types consistently throughout the codebase.\n2. Make `IEdge.Source` and `IEdge.Target` nullable in the interface.\n3. Make `Id` and `Type` readonly in the `Edge` class.\n4. Implement a consistent error handling strategy, either using exceptions or result objects.\n5. Add null checks in methods like `Edge.ConnectNodes`.\n6. Extend the observer pattern to include property change notifications.\n7. Add generic type constraints to `GetPropertyValue<T>` method.\n8. Standardize method naming conventions.\n9. Optimize `Node.GetAdjacentNodes` using a `HashSet`.\n10. Add XML documentation to public methods and classes.\n11. Remove unused using statements.\n12. Standardize the use of access modifiers for interface implementations.\n\nWould you like me to provide specific code changes to address these issues?",
