I'll create a TypeScript artifact to address the import and type issues you're experiencing.\n```\nViewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.\n```\n\n\n\nLet me explain the changes and reasoning:\n\n1. Import Error Resolution:\n   - The first error suggested an import issue with '@sharpee/core/execution/actions'\n   - I've adjusted the import to use '@sharpee/core/types/actions' and '@sharpee/core/types/language'\n   - This assumes you have type definitions in a 'types' directory within the core package\n\n2. LanguageProvider Method Error:\n   - The error indicated that 'getActionVerbList' doesn't exist on LanguageProvider\n   - I've added a fallback implementation using an optional chaining operator\n   - I've added a method that checks for an 'actionVerbs' property\n   - You may need to update your LanguageProvider interface to include this method or property\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Verify the exact import paths in your project structure\n2. Update the LanguageProvider interface in your core package to match these expectations\n3. Adjust the implementation if the exact method names or types differ\n\nWould you like me to help you update the related interfaces or provide more context about resolving these import and type issues?\n\nA few specific questions to help diagnose:\n1. Can you confirm the exact directory structure of your '@sharpee/core' package?\n2. Do you have a specific interface for LanguageProvider that I should reference?\n3. Are there any specific requirements for how action verbs should be handled?",

Based on the migration document and the build errors you shared, here's an updated implementation for the action helpers:\n```\nViewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.\n```\n\n\n\nKey changes based on the language migration document:\n1. Updated imports to use `@sharpee/stdlib/language/base/types`\n2. Changed `LanguageProvider` to `IFLanguagePlugin`\n3. Used `getRegisteredVerbs()` method to retrieve verb list\n4. Added more robust action creation and validation\n\nThe implementation now:\n- Uses the new language plugin base class\n- Follows the plugin architecture outlined in the migration doc\n- Provides type-safe verb and action management\n\nDoes this align with the changes you were expecting? I can make further adjustments if needed.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Verify the exact import paths in your project\n2. Ensure the `IFLanguagePlugin` interface has the `getRegisteredVerbs()` method\n3. Update any dependent code to use this new approach\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of the implementation or discuss how this fits into the broader language migration strategy?",

Should we provide a language plugin template/generator?\r\n2. How should language plugins handle regional variants (en-US vs en-GB)?\r\n3. Should parser plugins be separate from language plugins?\r\n4. How do we handle fallbacks for missing translations?",

Added more robust action creation and validation\n\nThe implementation now:\n- Uses the new language plugin base class\n- Follows the plugin architecture outlined in the migration doc\n- Provides type-safe verb and action management\n\nDoes this align with the changes you were expecting? I can make further adjustments if needed.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Verify the exact import paths in your project\n2. Ensure the `IFLanguagePlugin` interface has the `getRegisteredVerbs()` method\n3.
