This included the following:

Description of the World
The People of this World (generalized)
Religion (if applicable)
Magic or Technology
Physics
Astronomy
Recent History
Money
Common Expressions or Colloquialisms

Then

Prologue
The characters of the story
The Player Character
The NPCs
A synopsis or screen play of the entire story broken up by set pieces or scenes. These scenes can have overlapping aspects of the world.

Game Features
Time
Food

Chapter sections to detail how each set piece functions, including a rundown and a detailed design where we describe locations (rooms), actions, puzzles, and how the PC moves the story forward to the next Chapter
