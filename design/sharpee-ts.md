# Project Summary: TypeScript-based Interactive Fiction Engine

Our discussion focused on designing a modern interactive fiction engine in TypeScript. We analyzed different architectural approaches, starting with a graph-based design and evolving toward an immutable state model with extension capabilities.

## Assumptions

1. Fluent top layer for non-programmers
2. Core is story and mostly IF agnostic
3. Standard Library is IF Specific

## Key Insights

1. **Graph vs. Immutable State Tree**: 
   - Graph models offer flexibility for representing complex relationships
   - Immutable state trees provide cleaner state management and history tracking
   - TypeScript's type system works particularly well with immutable patterns

2. **Performance Considerations**:
   - A single player story should not have memory or performance issues
   - We may have async/await implementations, but nothing multi-threaded

3. **Extension Architecture**:
   - A stackable architecture allows starting simple and adding complexity as needed
   - TypeScript interfaces and generics provide type safety across extensions
   - Clear extension points enable modular development

## Recommended Approach

We recommend a stackable architecture with:

1. A minimal core engine handling basic world modeling
2. Type-safe extensions that declare their state requirements
3. Immutable state updates for predictable behavior
4. Clear extension points for pre/post command processing
5. Hooks for state change notifications
6. Author-friendly API Typescript layer (fluent)
7. Text is sent to an event source for post-turn processing.

This approach allows for:
- Simple games to remain simple
- Complex games to add only the features they need
- Type safety throughout the system
- Clean separation of concerns
- Predictable performance characteristics

The design also supports modern development practices with good tooling support, clear debugging paths, and a focus on maintainability.
