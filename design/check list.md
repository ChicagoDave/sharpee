Let's break out the core engine components for Sharpee in detail. This will help provide clarity on what's implemented and what still needs development.

# Core Engine Components Breakdown

## 1. World Model (Largely Implemented)

The foundation of your engine appears to be well established with:

- **State Tree & Entity System**
  - ✅ Immutable state management
  - ✅ Entity creation, querying, and modification
  - ✅ Relationship tracking between entities
  - ✅ History & undo/redo capabilities

- **Event System**
  - ✅ Event emitter implementation
  - ✅ Standard event types defined
  - ✅ Event listeners and handlers

- **Query Engine**
  - ✅ Entity queries by various criteria
  - ✅ Path finding between entities
  - ✅ Spatial relationship queries

## 2. Parser Library (Not Implemented)

- **Tokenizer**
  - ❌ Word and phrase tokenization
  - ❌ Handling of special characters and punctuation
  - ❌ Recognition of command boundaries

- **Grammar Rules**
  - ❌ Part-of-speech tagging
  - ❌ Verb-noun-preposition patterns
  - ❌ Command structure validation

- **Command Matcher**
  - ❌ Fuzzy matching algorithm
  - ❌ Disambiguation system
  - ❌ Synonym handling
  - ❌ Error correction for typos

- **Context-Aware Parsing**
  - ❌ Incorporating game state in parsing
  - ❌ Understanding pronoun references (it, them)
  - ❌ Implicit command completion

## 3. Command Execution System (Partially Implemented)

- **Command Processing Pipeline**
  - ⏳ Command validation
  - ⏳ Pre-execution hooks
  - ✅ State transformation (via state manager)
  - ⏳ Post-execution hooks

- **Action System**
  - ❌ Standard action definitions
  - ❌ Action preconditions and requirements
  - ❌ Action failure handling
  - ❌ Multi-step action sequences

- **Rules Engine**
  - ❌ Game rule definitions
  - ❌ Rule checking and enforcement
  - ❌ Consequence handling

## 4. Grammar/Output Library (Not Implemented)

- **Text Generation**
  - ❌ Response template system
  - ❌ Variable substitution
  - ❌ Conditional text generation

- **Natural Language Processing**
  - ❌ Pronoun resolution
  - ❌ Verb conjugation
  - ❌ Noun pluralization
  - ❌ Article selection (a/an/the)

- **Formatting System**
  - ❌ Typography controls
  - ❌ Paragraph management
  - ❌ List formatting

## 5. Extension Architecture (Partially Implemented)

- **Extension Framework**
  - ✅ Basic extension interfaces defined
  - ⏳ Extension registration
  - ❌ Extension dependency management

- **Hook System**
  - ✅ State change hooks
  - ❌ Parser hooks
  - ❌ Command hooks
  - ❌ Output hooks

## 6. Story Definition Format (Not Implemented)

- **Content Schema**
  - ❌ JSON/YAML story definition
  - ❌ Room/object/character templates
  - ❌ Action definitions

- **Author Tools**
  - ❌ Story validator
  - ❌ Compiler/transpiler for readable syntax
  - ❌ Chapter/scene organization

## 7. Integration Layer (Not Implemented)

- **External Interfaces**
  - ❌ Web client interface
  - ❌ React component bindings
  - ❌ I/O abstraction

- **Save/Load System**
  - ❌ Game state serialization
  - ❌ Save file management
  - ❌ Cross-platform storage

## Recommended Next Steps for Core Engine

1. **Parser Implementation**
   - Start with a basic tokenizer and command matcher
   - Implement verb-noun-object pattern recognition
   - Add disambiguation for common scenarios

2. **Text Generation System**
   - Create a templating system for responses
   - Implement basic grammar rules for proper text generation
   - Build pronoun handling system

3. **Command Processing**
   - Define standard actions (take, drop, examine, etc.)
   - Implement action precondition checking
   - Create the command execution pipeline

4. **Author-Friendly API**
   - Design the fluent interface for story definition
   - Create helper functions for common tasks
   - Build validators to catch common authoring mistakes
