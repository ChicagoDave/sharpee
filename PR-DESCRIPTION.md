## Title
feat: Implement Atomic Events Architecture - Complete Self-Contained Event System

## Description

### 🎯 Overview
This PR completes the implementation of the **Atomic Events Architecture**, transforming the Sharpee IF engine to use self-contained events with complete entity snapshots. This eliminates the need for world model queries during text generation and enables accurate historical replay.

### 🏗️ Architecture Changes

#### Three-Phase Action Pattern
All actions now follow a consistent three-phase execution pattern:
1. **Validate**: Check preconditions, return validation result
2. **Execute**: Perform state changes only (minimal logic)
3. **Report**: Generate ALL events with complete entity snapshots

#### Event Processing Pipeline
New event processing pipeline with three stages:
- **Migration**: Convert legacy events (payload → data)
- **Normalization**: Ensure consistent structure
- **Enrichment**: Add context (turn, player, location)

### 📊 Performance Impact
- **Average event size**: ~306 bytes
- **Room descriptions**: ~558 bytes
- **500-turn game estimate**: ~276KB
- **Memory usage**: Excellent - well within acceptable limits

### ✅ What's Included

#### Core Changes
- ✨ 10 actions migrated to three-phase pattern
- ✨ CommandExecutor refactored to thin orchestrator (~150 lines)
- ✨ Complete entity snapshots in all events
- ✨ Event processing pipeline in engine
- ✨ Function serialization for save/load

#### Text Service
- 🔥 Removed world model dependencies
- ✨ Uses entity snapshots from events
- ✨ Supports provider functions for dynamic content

#### Stories
- ✨ Cloak of Darkness updated to use event data
- ✨ Event handlers use snapshots instead of world queries

#### Testing & Documentation
- 📝 ADR-058: Complete architecture documentation with migration guide
- 🧪 Historical accuracy tests
- 📈 Performance analysis tests
- ✅ All existing tests passing

### 🔄 Migration Guide

For action authors:
```typescript
// Old pattern
execute(context): SemanticEvent[] {
  if (!valid) return [error];
  doChanges();
  return [success];
}

// New pattern
validate(context): ValidationResult
execute(context): void  // state changes only
report(context, validation?): SemanticEvent[]  // all events
```

For story authors:
```typescript
// Old: Query world model
const item = context.world.getEntity(event.data.itemId);

// New: Use event snapshot
const item = event.data.item;  // Complete snapshot
```

**Reviewers**: Please pay special attention to:
1. Event size measurements in performance tests
2. Migration path for existing actions
3. Backward compatibility handling in event-adapter.ts
