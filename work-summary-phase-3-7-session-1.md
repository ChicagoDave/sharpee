# Work Summary - Phase 3.7 Core Refactoring (Session 1)

**Date:** June 29, 2025  
**Completed:** Steps 1-3 of Phase 3.7

## What We Accomplished

### Step 1: Event Source Infrastructure ✅
- Created `GenericEventSource<T>` - A generic pub/sub event system
- Created `SystemEvent` interface for debug/monitoring events  
- Created `SemanticEventSource` that extends the generic source for story events
- Replaced old EventSource with new architecture while maintaining backwards compatibility
- Added comprehensive tests for the new event system

### Step 2: Prepared World-Model ✅
- Created command types in `world-model/src/commands/`:
  - `ParsedCommand`, `ValidatedCommand`, and related types
  - Command error types and result types
- Created interfaces in `world-model/src/interfaces/`:
  - `Parser`, `CommandValidator`, `CommandExecutor`, `CommandProcessor`
  - New `Action` interface designed for three-phase architecture
- Updated world-model exports to include all IF-specific types

### Step 3: Updated Parser Package ✅
- Updated all parser imports to use types from `@sharpee/world-model`
- Fixed naming conflict by renaming old ParsedCommand to ResolvedCommand
- Updated debug event handling to use SystemEvent
- Cleaned up parser to use new architecture

## Key Architectural Changes

1. **Event System Redesign**
   - Generic event source for any event type
   - Separate SystemEvent (debug) from SemanticEvent (story)
   - Clean pub/sub pattern with error handling

2. **Type Organization**
   - IF-specific types moved to world-model (commands, interfaces)
   - Core becoming truly generic (just events, entities, basic types)
   - World-model is now the "IF framework" package

3. **Three-Phase Architecture**
   - Parse → ParsedCommand (syntax only)
   - Validate → ValidatedCommand (resolved entities)
   - Execute → SemanticEvent[] (story events)

## What's Next

### Immediate Tasks (Steps 4-6):
- **Step 4:** Update Validator Package (~2 hours)
- **Step 5:** Update Actions (~3 hours)  
- **Step 6:** Update Engine Package (~2 hours)

### Then (Steps 7-10):
- **Step 7:** Clean Up Core Package
- **Step 8:** Update Peripheral Packages
- **Step 9:** Build and Test
- **Step 10:** Migration and Cleanup

## Important Notes

1. **Breaking Changes** - This refactor introduces breaking changes:
   - All imports of command types must change from `@sharpee/core` to `@sharpee/world-model`
   - Debug event handling has changed from EventSource to callbacks
   - Some interfaces renamed (no I-prefix)

2. **Git Branch Recommended** - Before continuing, create a feature branch to allow rollback if needed

3. **Build State** - We haven't run a full build yet. Recommend doing this early in next session.

## Files Modified So Far

### Core Package:
- `/events/event-source.ts` (new)
- `/events/system-event.ts` (new)
- `/events/semantic-event-source.ts` (new)
- `/events/event-system.ts` (modified)
- `/events/types.ts` (modified)
- `/events/index.ts` (modified)

### World-Model Package:
- `/commands/` directory (new)
- `/interfaces/` directory (new)
- `/index.ts` (modified)

### Stdlib Package:
- `/parser/basic-parser.ts` (modified)
- `/parser/parser-types.ts` (modified)
- `/parser/parsed-command.ts` (modified)
- `/parser/command-resolver.ts` (modified)

## Estimated Remaining Work

- ~7-8 hours to complete remaining steps
- ~40+ more files to update
- Testing and documentation after code changes

## Recommendations for Next Session

1. Create git branch before continuing
2. Run a test build to catch any issues early
3. Continue with Step 4 (Validator Package)
4. Consider doing Steps 4-6 together as they're related
5. Leave plenty of time for Step 9 (Build and Test)
