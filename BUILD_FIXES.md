# Build Fixes Applied

## 1. Excluded Forge Package
- Removed from `package.json` workspaces
- Added exclusion `!packages/forge` in `lerna.json`
- Added README.md to forge package explaining it's not implemented

## 2. Fixed Engine Package Configuration
- Changed output directory from `lib` to `dist` in `tsconfig.json`
- Updated `package.json` main/types to point to `dist`
- Fixed dependencies to use `workspace:*` syntax
- Removed non-existent `@sharpee/actions` dependency

## 3. Fixed TypeScript Errors in Engine
- Changed `commandExecutor` to use definite assignment assertion (`!`)
- Already fixed trait usage in `createStandardEngine`

## 4. Fixed Trait Usage in Cloak of Darkness
- Changed all `nouns` properties to `aliases`
- Removed `adjectives` arrays (not part of IdentityTrait)
- Fixed container/supporter capacity to use object format
- Fixed room exits to use ExitInfo objects with `destination` property
- Removed LIGHT_SOURCE traits (rooms use baseLight property instead)

## Next Steps

1. Run `.\fix-and-build.ps1` to clean, install deps, and rebuild
2. If build succeeds, the engine is ready to use
3. Consider creating a simple client to test the engine
4. Add more stories using the same pattern as Cloak of Darkness
