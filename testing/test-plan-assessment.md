# Test Plan Accuracy Assessment

## Summary
After reviewing the entire Core implementation, the original test plan was **partially accurate** but had some incorrect assumptions about the architecture.

## What Was Correct ✓
1. **Event System Focus** - Correctly identified events as central
2. **Layer Isolation** - Core is indeed minimal and isolated
3. **Test Structure** - Phases approach makes sense
4. **Verification Focus** - Good principle to verify, not modify

## What Was Wrong ✗

### 1. **Assumed Components That Don't Exist**
- ❌ **WorldState** - Not in Core (likely in world-model package)
- ❌ **Entity class** - Only interfaces exist
- ❌ **Action class** - Only interfaces exist
- ❌ **EventBus** - It's called SimpleEventSource

### 2. **Missed Actual Components**
- ❌ **Rule System** - Complete implementation exists
- ❌ **Language System** - Registry and provider pattern
- ❌ **Result Type** - Functional utilities
- ❌ **Debug Infrastructure** - Separate from semantic events

### 3. **Architecture Misunderstandings**
- Thought Core would have state management
- Expected concrete implementations of entities/actions
- Didn't realize the modular package structure

## What's Actually in Core

### Interfaces/Types Only:
- Entity, Relationship, Attribute types
- CommandHandler, Action, CommandRouter interfaces
- Extension type definitions
- Debug event types

### Actual Implementations:
- **SimpleEventSource** - Generic pub/sub
- **SemanticEventSource** - Story events with queries
- **SimpleRuleSystem** - Full rule engine
- **LanguageRegistry** - Provider management
- **Result** - Functional programming utilities
- **Event creation helpers**

## Updated Test Coverage Needed

### High Priority (Has Implementation):
1. **Rule System** (~5 test files)
   - Rule matching and execution
   - Event prevention
   - Entity changes
   - Priority handling

2. **Language System** (~2 test files)
   - Registry operations
   - Provider management
   - Default provider

3. **Result Type** (~1 test file)
   - All the functional utilities
   - Type narrowing
   - Chaining operations

### Medium Priority:
4. **System Events** (fix existing test)
5. **Event System Helpers** 
6. **Debug Infrastructure**

### Low Priority (Mostly Interfaces):
7. Type definitions verification
8. Constants verification
9. Extension types

## Test Effort Estimate

### Already Done:
- ✓ SimpleEventSource 
- ✓ SemanticEventSource
- ~ SystemEvent (needs fix)

### To Do:
- 5 files for Rules
- 2 files for Language  
- 1 file for Result
- 2 files for Integration
- 2-3 files for remaining

**Total: ~15 test files** (have 3, need 12 more)

## Recommendations

1. **Fix the existing SystemEvent test** - Make it match implementation
2. **Focus on Rule System next** - It's the most complex implementation
3. **Then Language System** - Another concrete implementation
4. **Add Result type tests** - Important utilities
5. **Skip interface-only tests** - TypeScript handles these

The original plan's structure is good, but needs to be adjusted for what's actually implemented vs what's just interfaces.
