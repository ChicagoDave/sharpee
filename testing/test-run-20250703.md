# Core Tests - Initial Run Results

## Date: 2025-07-03

### Test Run Summary
- **Total Test Suites**: 4
- **Passed**: 1 (event-source.test.ts)
- **Failed**: 3

### Issues Found

#### 1. Existing Test Failure: `system-event.test.ts`
- **Issue**: Test expects `isSystemEvent()` to validate property types, but implementation only checks property existence
- **Test Line**: `should reject objects with wrong types`
- **Expected**: `isSystemEvent({ id: 123, ... })` should return `false`
- **Actual**: Returns `true` because it doesn't check if `id` is a string
- **Action**: Document for discussion - should the implementation be enhanced to check types?

#### 2. Import Issues in New Tests
- **Issue**: Our test structure assumed different module organization
- **Found**: 
  - No `EventBus` class - it's called `SimpleEventSource`
  - No `WorldState` in core - appears to be in another package
  - No standalone `Action` class in expected location
- **Action**: Updated test utilities to work with actual core structure

#### 3. Architecture Observations
- Core uses `SemanticEvent` as the primary event type
- Event system is based on `SimpleEventSource` and `SemanticEventSource`
- Core is truly minimal - doesn't include world state management
- Types are well-defined but spread across multiple files

### Next Steps
1. Fix the import issues in our test files âœ“
2. Run tests again to verify fixes
3. Continue with Phase 1 (Event System) tests
4. Document any other findings for discussion

### Architecture Notes
The actual Core architecture is more minimal than expected:
- **Events**: SimpleEventSource, SemanticEventSource, SystemEvent
- **Types**: Entity, Relationship, Attribute, Result
- **Execution**: Command handling and action interfaces
- **Extensions**: Extension system types
- **Language**: Language service interfaces
- **Rules**: Rule system interfaces

World state management appears to be in a separate package (likely `world-model`).
