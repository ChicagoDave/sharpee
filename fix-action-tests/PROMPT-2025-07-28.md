Continue fixing action tests in the Sharpee IF platform.

## Current State
We've successfully migrated 3 action test suites to match the new typed event system:

1. **Taking** - 18/19 passing (1 skipped: needs getTotalWeight())
2. **Dropping** - 15/17 passing (2 skipped: need ADR-043 scope implementation)  
3. **Examining** - All tests passing

## Key Learnings Applied
- All entities except rooms/actors should be created with type 'object'
- Event data must include ALL properties from typed event interfaces
- Success/error event params should match the domain event data
- `context.currentLocation` is always the room (for consistent context)
- Scope determines where actions happen (needs ADR-043 implementation)

## Design Decisions Made
- Created ADR-043 for scope resolution and implied indirect objects
- Fixed dropping action to allow dropping inside closed containers
- Updated test context to use getContainingRoom() for currentLocation

## Next Batch of Actions
Review the method list at `/fix-action-tests/method-list.md` and select 2-3 actions to migrate. Good candidates:
- **going** - Movement action with different patterns
- **opening/closing** - State change actions, simpler patterns  
- **giving** - Multi-entity action for complex interactions
- **putting** - Similar to dropping but with explicit destinations

## Migration Checklist
1. Update imports from Jest to Vitest
2. Check action implementation and typed events
3. Update all event expectations to include full typed data
4. Update success/error params to match domain events
5. Fix entity creation (use 'object' type, not trait names)
6. Run tests and fix any issues
7. Document any skipped tests with clear TODOs

## Known Issues
- Some actions may depend on unimplemented scope resolution (ADR-043)
- Weight-based tests need getTotalWeight() in world model
- Some tests may reveal additional design gaps
