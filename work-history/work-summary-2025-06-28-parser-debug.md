# Work Summary - Parser Refactor & Debug System Implementation

**Date:** June 28, 2025
**Session Focus:** Completing parser refactor, implementing debug events, and preparing for validator completion

## What We Accomplished

### 1. **Completed Parser Refactor to New Architecture**
   - Updated `BasicParser` to implement `IParser` interface
   - Added `parse()` method returning `CommandResult<ParsedCommand, ParseError>`
   - Made `CandidateCommand` internal by moving to `parser-internals.ts`
   - Removed `parseMultiple()` from public API
   - Parser is now completely world-agnostic

### 2. **Implemented Parser Debug Events**
   - Created debug event types in `@sharpee/core/events/debug-events.ts`
   - Added `setDebugEventSource()` to parser interface
   - Parser now emits 4 types of debug events:
     - `tokenize`: Token generation details
     - `pattern_match`: Grammar pattern matching attempts
     - `candidate_selection`: How the best candidate was chosen
     - `parse_error`: Details about parsing failures

### 3. **Started CommandValidator Implementation**
   - Created basic structure in `/packages/stdlib/src/validation/`
   - Implements `ICommandValidator` interface
   - Basic entity resolution (by type/name only)
   - Simple visibility checks (same room + inventory)
   - Needs significant enhancement for real-world use

### 4. **Created Architecture Decision Records**
   - **ADR-001**: Parser Debug Events Architecture
   - **ADR-002**: Debug Mode Meta Commands (DEBUG ON/OFF)
   - **ADR-003**: Internal Parser Types
   - Summary document linking all decisions

## Key Design Decisions

1. **No Adapters Needed** - Updated stdlib directly since it's not settled code
2. **Debug Events are Opt-in** - No performance impact unless explicitly enabled
3. **CandidateCommand is Internal** - Clean public API exposes only ParsedCommand
4. **Debug Mode via Meta Commands** - DEBUG ON/OFF will control event collection/display

## Current State

**‚úÖ Completed:**
- Parser fully refactored and world-agnostic
- Debug event system implemented
- Type definitions in @sharpee/core
- Documentation and ADRs

**üöß In Progress:**
- CommandValidator has basic structure but needs:
  - Adjective matching (red ball vs blue ball)
  - Scope rules (visible, reachable, touchable)
  - Pronoun resolution ("it", "them")
  - Ambiguity handling
  - Debug event support

**‚ùå Not Started:**
- Actions still use old ParsedCommand type
- CommandProcessor to chain phases
- DEBUG ON/OFF command implementation
- Integration testing

## Next Session Should Focus On

1. **Complete CommandValidator**
   - Enhance entity resolution logic
   - Add debug events to validator
   - Extract/refactor CommandResolver logic
   - Define ActionMetadata interface

2. **Do NOT Yet:**
   - Update actions (that's Phase 3)
   - Create CommandProcessor (that's Phase 4)
   - Implement debug commands (can wait)

## Important Files Created/Modified

- `/packages/core/src/command/types.ts` - New command processing types
- `/packages/core/src/events/debug-events.ts` - Debug event definitions
- `/packages/stdlib/src/parser/parser-internals.ts` - Internal parser types
- `/packages/stdlib/src/parser/basic-parser.ts` - Updated with new interface
- `/packages/stdlib/src/validation/command-validator.ts` - Basic validator
- `/decisions/adr-001-parser-debug-events.md`
- `/decisions/adr-002-debug-mode-meta-commands.md`
- `/decisions/adr-003-internal-parser-types.md`

## Context for Next Developer

The parser is now clean and world-agnostic, emitting useful debug events. The three-phase architecture (Parse ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Execute) is taking shape. The validator is the critical next piece - it needs to handle all the complex entity resolution that used to be scattered throughout the system. Once the validator is complete, updating actions should be straightforward.

This refactor remains THE blocker for v1. We're about 40% complete overall.
