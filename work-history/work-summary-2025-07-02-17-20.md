# Work Summary - July 2, 2025, 17:20

## Overview
Successfully configured and built the Cloak of Darkness story implementation for the Sharpee IF engine. Resolved multiple build configuration issues related to TypeScript project references and package manager setup.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed TypeScript Build Configuration
- Created `tsconfig.dev.json` for development builds with proper path mappings
- Added `composite: true` to engine package's tsconfig.json for project references
- Updated imports in Cloak of Darkness to use specific packages instead of aggregate

### 2. Resolved Package Manager Issues
- Identified that project uses pnpm with `workspace:*` protocol
- Created `pnpm-workspace.yaml` configuration file
- Fixed package.json files that had version numbers instead of workspace references:
  - `packages/stdlib/package.json`
  - `packages/world-model/package.json`
  - `packages/client-core/package.json`
- Added `@types/node` to engine package dependencies
- Excluded non-essential packages from workspace (forge, extensions, client packages)

### 3. Fixed Cloak of Darkness Implementation
- Changed `isWorn` to `worn` in WearableTrait
- Replaced function bindings with static strings for `description` and `text` properties
- Added `updateMessage()` method to dynamically update message state
- Added proper type annotations for event handlers

### 4. Package Structure
Successfully building these core packages:
- @sharpee/core
- @sharpee/world-model
- @sharpee/stdlib
- @sharpee/engine
- @sharpee/event-processor
- @sharpee/lang-en-us
- @sharpee/story-cloak-of-darkness

## Current State
- All dependencies installed successfully via pnpm
- Cloak of Darkness story compiles without errors
- Ready to build and run with:
  ```bash
  cd stories/cloak-of-darkness
  pnpm run build:deps
  pnpm run play
  ```

## Important Notes

### Package Manager
- Project uses **pnpm** (not npm) with `workspace:*` protocol
- Must use `pnpm` commands instead of `npm`
- Workspace configuration in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`

### Build Commands
- `pnpm run build:deps` - Builds story with all dependencies
- `pnpm run build:dev` - Builds just the story (assumes deps built)
- `pnpm run play` - Runs the compiled story

### Module System
- Using ES modules with `"type": "module"` in package.json
- TypeScript compiles to ESNext modules
- Node.js runs with ES module support

## Next Steps
1. Run `pnpm run build:deps` to compile everything
2. Run `pnpm run play` to test the Cloak of Darkness implementation
3. Verify game mechanics work correctly (hanging cloak, reading message, etc.)
