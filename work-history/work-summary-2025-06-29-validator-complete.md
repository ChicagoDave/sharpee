# Work Summary - Enhanced CommandValidator Implementation

**Date:** June 29, 2025
**Session Focus:** Completing the CommandValidator with all complex entity resolution features

## What We Accomplished

### 1. **Implemented Full-Featured CommandValidator**
   - Complete rewrite of the basic validator with sophisticated entity resolution
   - Added comprehensive scoring system for entity matching
   - Implemented all requested features from the specification

### 2. **Advanced Entity Resolution Features**
   - **Adjective Matching**: Distinguishes "red ball" from "blue ball"
   - **Scope Rules**: Enforces visible/reachable/touchable constraints
   - **Pronoun Resolution**: Tracks "it", "them", "him", "her" references
   - **Ambiguity Handling**: Smart resolution with fallback to user prompts
   - **Synonym Support**: Matches "container" to "box" via synonyms

### 3. **Scoring System Implementation**
   - Multi-factor scoring algorithm:
     - Exact name match: 10 points
     - Name contains word: 5 points  
     - Type match: 4 points
     - Adjective match: 3 points
     - Synonym match: 2 points
     - Plus bonuses for visibility, reachability, recency, inventory

### 4. **Debug Event Integration**
   - Added four debug event types:
     - `entity_resolution`: Details about matching process
     - `scope_check`: Shows considered entities and why
     - `ambiguity_resolution`: Explains disambiguation decisions
     - `validation_error`: Provides error context

### 5. **Action Metadata Interface**
   - Created `ActionMetadata` interface for declaring requirements
   - Actions can specify:
     - Required objects (direct/indirect)
     - Scope requirements (visible/reachable/touchable)
     - Valid prepositions

### 6. **Comprehensive Test Suite**
   - Created 20+ test cases covering all features
   - Tests for edge cases and complex scenarios
   - Mock implementations for testing in isolation

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Scoring Over Rules** - Used a flexible scoring system instead of rigid rules to handle edge cases better

2. **Stateful Pronoun Tracking** - Validator maintains resolution context for pronoun references

3. **Graceful Ambiguity Handling** - Multiple strategies to auto-resolve before asking user

4. **Entity Property Extraction** - Flexible methods to extract names, adjectives, synonyms from various entity formats

5. **Scope Service Integration** - Uses world model's ScopeService when available, with sensible fallbacks

## Code Quality Improvements

- Removed old `CommandResolver` dependency
- Cleaned up imports and interfaces
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Followed TypeScript best practices
- Made debug events optional for performance

## Files Created/Modified

- `/packages/stdlib/src/validation/command-validator.ts` - Complete rewrite (~800 lines)
- `/packages/stdlib/src/validation/command-validator.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite
- `/packages/stdlib/src/validation/index.ts` - Module exports
- `/packages/stdlib/src/validation/README.md` - Documentation
- `/packages/stdlib/src/index.ts` - Added validation exports

## Current State

**✅ Completed:**
- Parser fully refactored (Phase 1)
- Debug event system (Phase 2)
- CommandValidator fully implemented (Phase 3)
- All complex entity resolution features
- Comprehensive testing

**❌ Not Started:**
- Updating actions to use ValidatedCommand (Phase 4)
- Creating CommandProcessor (Phase 5)
- Fixing circular dependencies (Phase 6)

## Next Steps

The next session should focus on Phase 4: Updating Actions

1. **Update Action Interface**
   - Change from `ParsedCommand` to `ValidatedCommand`
   - Add metadata properties to actions
   - Remove validation logic from actions

2. **Update Each Action**
   - `takingAction`: Remove visibility checks (validator handles)
   - `droppingAction`: Remove "already dropped" checks
   - `goingAction`: Keep only business logic
   - `openingAction`: Keep only "is it locked?" logic
   - All actions: Trust validated entities

3. **Update Action Tests**
   - Create `ValidatedCommand` objects for testing
   - Remove validation failure tests
   - Focus on business logic tests

## Important Notes

- The validator is now THE single source of truth for entity resolution
- All complex matching logic is centralized in one place
- Debug events provide full visibility into the resolution process
- The scoring system is tunable - weights can be adjusted if needed

## Context for Next Developer

The CommandValidator is now feature-complete and handles all the complex entity resolution that was previously scattered throughout the system. It's well-tested and documented. The next critical step is updating all actions to use ValidatedCommand instead of ParsedCommand. This should be straightforward since the validator now handles all the complex work that actions were previously doing.

This marks the completion of Phase 3 of the parser-validation-execution refactor. We're approximately 60% complete with the overall refactor.
