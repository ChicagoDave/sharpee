# Work Summary - Phase 3.7 Core Refactoring

**Date:** July 1, 2025  
**Session Focus:** Completing Phase 3.7 of the Parser-Validation-Execution Refactor

## Overview

This session focused on completing the core refactoring (Phase 3.7) of the Sharpee IF platform, which involved separating IF-specific types from the generic core and establishing a clean architecture for language support.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Completed Core Refactoring (Phase 3.7)
- **Moved IF-specific types from core to world-model**
  - `ParsedCommand`, `ValidatedCommand`, and related types now live in `@sharpee/world-model`
  - Core is now truly generic, containing only event and entity abstractions
  - This allows core to be reused for other narrative engines (visual novels, RPGs, etc.)

- **Updated all package imports** (~50+ files)
  - Fixed imports across stdlib, engine, world-model, and other packages
  - Ensured clean dependency hierarchy

### 2. Fixed Language Package Architecture

**Key Insight:** Language packages should be self-contained with NO dependencies on other @sharpee packages.

**Before:**
```
lang-en-us → imports from → stdlib (circular dependency issue)
```

**After:**
```
lang-en-us (standalone, zero dependencies)
    ↓
stdlib (adapts language data via adapter functions)
```

**Changes Made:**
- Made `lang-en-us` completely self-contained
- Created adapter functions in stdlib to convert language data to internal types
- Language provider interface now uses `any` types to allow flexibility
- Parser now requires a language provider in its constructor

### 3. Cleaned Up Legacy Code

**Moved to .archived directories:**
- Old english-plugin.ts implementation
- Legacy parser plugin system
- Deprecated command types
- Old test files

**Kept and updated:**
- All language data files (verbs.ts, words.ts, messages.ts, events.ts, templates.ts)
- Created new clean `EnglishLanguageProvider` implementation

### 4. Fixed Dependency Hierarchy

**Correct dependency flow:**
```
core (generic event/entity system)
    ↓
world-model (IF domain model - entities, commands, traits)
    ↓
stdlib (IF standard library - parser, validator, actions)
    ↓
engine (game engine - orchestrates everything)

lang-en-us (standalone language provider)
```

### 5. Parser Architecture Updates

- Parser is now language-agnostic and lives in stdlib
- Must be instantiated with a language provider
- Language provider supplies:
  - Vocabulary (verbs, nouns, adjectives, etc.)
  - Grammar patterns
  - Lemmatization rules
  - Text formatting functions

### 6. Action Interface Resolution

- Removed Action interface from world-model
- `ValidatedCommand` now stores `actionId: string` instead of action handler reference
- Actions remain in stdlib where they belong
- Cleaner separation: world-model = state, stdlib = execution

## Technical Details

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **No I prefix for interfaces** - Following modern TypeScript conventions
2. **Const objects over enums** - Better tree-shaking and type inference
3. **Language packages below stdlib** - Clean dependency direction
4. **Parser requires language** - No singleton parser instance

### Files Modified/Created

- Created language provider interface in stdlib
- Updated parser to require language provider
- Created new EnglishLanguageProvider in lang-en-us
- Fixed all TypeScript/ESLint errors in modified files
- Updated package.json files to reflect correct dependencies

## Build Status

All packages now compile successfully after:
- Fixing import paths
- Resolving circular dependencies  
- Updating type definitions
- Cleaning up unused code

## Next Steps

The foundation is now solid for:
1. Implementing Phase 5 - Update Engine to use new command flow
2. Creating comprehensive tests for the three-phase architecture
3. Writing documentation for the new architecture
4. Adding support for additional languages

## Key Takeaways

1. **Clean architecture matters** - Having lang-en-us import from stdlib created uncomfortable coupling
2. **Self-contained modules** - Language packages should be completely independent
3. **Adapter pattern** - Stdlib adapts to language packages, not the other way around
4. **Clear boundaries** - Each package has a specific responsibility in the hierarchy
5. **Type safety + flexibility** - Using `any` at boundaries allows flexibility while maintaining internal type safety

## Session Highlights

- Successfully identified and fixed the "dependency direction" issue
- Maintained all valuable language data while reorganizing architecture
- Achieved zero dependencies for language packages
- Established pattern for future language implementations
- Fixed all build errors while maintaining clean architecture
