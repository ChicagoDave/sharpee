# Work Summary - Event Processor Refactoring
**Date**: 2025-01-04 02:15 AM
**Session**: Event Processor Unit Testing & Domain Refactoring

## Summary

This session focused on setting up unit testing for the event-processor package, which led to discovering architectural issues and implementing a domain-driven refactoring.

## Work Completed

### 1. Event Processor Test Setup
- Created comprehensive test infrastructure for event-processor package
- Set up Jest configuration with TypeScript support
- Created test directory structure:
  - `tests/unit/` - Unit tests for core functionality
  - `tests/integration/` - Integration tests (placeholder)
  - `tests/fixtures/` - Mock implementations and test data
- Created mock implementations:
  - `MockWorldModel` - Test double for WorldModel interface
  - Test event fixtures for common scenarios
- Wrote initial unit tests for:
  - EventProcessor core functionality
  - Reaction system with depth limiting
  - Handler registration (blocked by missing imports)

### 2. Discovered Architectural Issues
- **Missing IFEvents Export**: Handler modules import `IFEvents` from `@sharpee/world-model`, but it's not exported
- **Duplicate Event Processing**: Found that world-model already implements event processing functionality
- **Circular Dependency Risk**: event-processor depends on world-model types that don't exist in exports

### 3. Architectural Analysis
Investigated the relationship between packages:
- **world-model**: Has built-in event processing (handlers, validators, previewers)
- **event-processor**: Provides higher-level orchestration (batch processing, reactions, validation options)
- **engine**: Uses event-processor for game turn execution
- Confirmed event-processor IS being used by the engine package

### 4. Domain-Driven Refactoring (Phase 1 Complete)
Created `@sharpee/if-domain` package to solve architectural issues:

#### Package Structure
```
packages/if-domain/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts         # Main exports
│   ├── events.ts        # IFEvents constants and types
│   ├── contracts.ts     # EventHandler, Validator, Previewer types
│   ├── changes.ts       # WorldChange and related types
│   └── sequencing.ts    # Turn phases and event sequencing
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

#### Types Migrated
- From world-model: IFEvents, EventHandler, EventValidator, EventPreviewer, WorldChange
- From event-processor: ProcessedEvents, ProcessorOptions
- From engine: TurnPhase, EventSequence, SequencedEvent, EventSequencer

## Key Decisions

1. **Created @sharpee/if-domain Package**
   - Rejected "shared-types" name as anti-pattern
   - Chose domain-driven name reflecting IF domain model
   - Contains only domain contracts and constants

2. **Preserved Existing Architecture**
   - event-processor remains as orchestration layer
   - world-model keeps low-level event handling
   - No functionality changes, only type extraction

3. **Phased Migration Approach**
   - Phase 1: Create if-domain package (COMPLETE)
   - Phase 2: Update package dependencies
   - Phase 3: Update imports across packages
   - Phase 4: Clean build and test
   - Comprehensive checklist created for tracking

## Technical Challenges

1. **Git/Symlink Issues**
   - Package symlinks were causing VS Code Git errors
   - Added symlinks to .gitignore
   - Configured line endings with .gitattributes

2. **Build Order Dependencies**
   - New build order: core → if-domain → world-model → event-processor → stdlib → engine
   - Must maintain this order during migration

3. **Test Compilation Errors**
   - TypeScript couldn't resolve imports due to missing exports
   - Led to discovery of the architectural issues

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 2: Update Dependencies**
   - Add @sharpee/if-domain to package.json files
   - Run pnpm install to create symlinks

2. **Phase 3: Update Imports**
   - Update all packages to import from if-domain
   - Remove duplicate type definitions
   - Extensive search/replace operation

3. **Phase 4: Verify Everything Works**
   - Clean build all packages
   - Run all tests
   - Verify no circular dependencies

## Artifacts Created

1. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Complete test setup for event-processor
   - Mock implementations ready for use
   - Tests written but blocked by import issues

2. **@sharpee/if-domain Package**
   - Complete domain model package
   - All types extracted and organized
   - Ready for integration

3. **Migration Checklist**
   - Comprehensive checklist with rollback plan
   - Phase 1 marked complete
   - Clear path forward for remaining phases

## Lessons Learned

1. **Test Early**: Setting up tests revealed architectural issues that might have been missed
2. **Domain-Driven Design Works**: Moving to domain-focused package names improves clarity
3. **Phased Refactoring**: Breaking large changes into phases makes them manageable
4. **Document Everything**: The checklist will be invaluable for completing this refactoring

## Time Investment
- ~3 hours total
- 1 hour on test setup and debugging
- 1 hour on architectural analysis
- 1 hour on creating if-domain package

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Test infrastructure created (blocked but ready)
- ✅ Architectural issues identified and understood
- ✅ Domain package created with all necessary types
- ✅ Clear migration path established
- ⏳ Tests will pass once migration complete

The session successfully transformed a testing task into a valuable architectural improvement that will benefit the entire codebase.
