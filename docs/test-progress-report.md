# Test Fixing Progress Report

## Summary

We've made significant progress fixing the stdlib tests:

### Issues Fixed

1. **world.getEntityByName() Pattern** (40+ failures resolved)
   - Fixed `throwing-golden.test.ts` (24 failures) ✅
   - Fixed `touching-golden.test.ts` (17 failures) ✅
   - Added import for `attacking-golden.test.ts` (1 failure) ✅
   - `drinking-golden.test.ts` didn't need fixing (no getEntityByName calls) ✅

2. **Platform Actions Missing Player** (32 failures resolved)
   - Fixed `platform-actions.test.ts` (22 failures) ✅
   - Fixed `quitting.test.ts` (10 failures) ✅

### Remaining Issues

1. **Registry Pattern Matching** (12 failures)
   - `registry-golden.test.ts` needs mock language provider

2. **Event Structure Mismatches** (35+ failures)
   - Various tests expecting different event data than what's emitted
   - Need to update expectations to match actual implementation

3. **Inventory Event Structure** (13 failures)
   - `inventory-golden.test.ts` needs event structure updates

### Next Steps

1. Fix registry tests by adding mock language provider
2. Update event expectations in remaining test files
3. Run full test suite to verify fixes

## Files Fixed So Far
- throwing-golden.test.ts ✅
- touching-golden.test.ts ✅
- platform-actions.test.ts ✅
- quitting.test.ts ✅
- attacking-golden.test.ts (import added) ✅

## Estimated Completion
- Already resolved: ~73 failures (61%)
- Remaining: ~46 failures (39%)
- Estimated time to complete: 1-2 hours

The bulk of the repetitive issues have been fixed. The remaining issues are more specific to individual test expectations and will require case-by-case updates.
