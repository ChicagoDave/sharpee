# Event-Driven Action System Implementation Summary

## What Was Created

### 1. @sharpee/actions Package

A new package implementing pure, event-driven actions that:
- Validate conditions using read-only world access
- Return semantic events describing what should happen
- Never mutate state directly
- Support extensibility through the ActionExecutor interface

**Key Components:**
- `ActionExecutor` interface - defines how actions work
- `ActionContext` interface - read-only world access for actions  
- `ParsedCommand` interface - represents parsed user input
- `ReadOnlyActionContext` - implementation of context
- `StandardActionRegistry` - registry for action executors

**Standard Actions Implemented:**
- `takingAction` - picks up objects with full validation
- `droppingAction` - puts down held objects
- `examiningAction` - looks at objects (read-only)
- `openingAction` - opens containers and doors
- `goingAction` - movement with complex validation

### 2. @sharpee/event-processor Package

Bridges events to world mutations by:
- Registering event handlers that apply changes
- Processing events in batches
- Supporting event validation and preview
- Handling reaction chains with depth limiting

**Key Components:**
- `EventProcessor` class - main processor implementation
- Movement handlers - handle TAKEN, DROPPED, ACTOR_MOVED, etc.
- State change handlers - handle OPENED, CLOSED, LOCKED, etc.
- Automatic handler registration for standard IF events

## How It Works

### Event Flow
```
1. User types: "take ball"
2. Parser creates ParsedCommand
3. Action validates and returns: [TAKEN event]
4. Event processor applies event via registered handler
5. Handler calls world.moveEntity(ball, player)
6. Text generator produces: "You take the red ball."
```

### Example Usage
```typescript
// Setup
const world = new WorldModel();
const actionRegistry = new StandardActionRegistry();
const eventProcessor = new EventProcessor(world);

// Execute action
const context = new ReadOnlyActionContext(world, player, room);
const events = takingAction.execute(command, context);

// Apply events
const results = eventProcessor.processEvents(events);
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Actions Return Events, Not Success/Failure
Instead of imperative success/failure, actions return semantic events that describe what happened. This enables:
- Complete audit trail of game state changes
- Undo/redo capability (future)
- Rule engine integration (future)
- Multiplayer synchronization (future)

### 2. Read-Only Context
Actions receive a read-only view of the world, preventing accidental mutations and ensuring all changes flow through events.

### 3. Handler Registration Pattern
World-model provides generic event infrastructure. Specific handlers are registered externally, maintaining separation of concerns.

### 4. Validation in Actions, Mutation in Handlers
Actions handle all validation logic. Handlers assume events are valid and just apply the changes.

## Benefits

1. **Traceability** - Every state change has an associated event
2. **Extensibility** - New actions and events can be added without modifying core
3. **Testability** - Actions are pure functions, easy to test
4. **Consistency** - All state changes follow the same pattern
5. **Decoupling** - Actions don't know how events are applied

## Migration Path

To migrate existing stdlib code:
1. Remove all direct world mutations
2. Replace with appropriate event returns
3. Ensure all validation happens before event creation
4. Register handlers for any custom events

## Next Steps

1. Implement remaining standard actions (closing, locking, wearing, etc.)
2. Add event validation system
3. Create rule engine integration
4. Implement undo/redo using event history
5. Build text generation from events
6. Add more complex event reactions

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the event-driven architecture that Sharpee requires.
