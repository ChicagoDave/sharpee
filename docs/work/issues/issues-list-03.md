## Open Issues

### ISSUE-031: UNDO command not implemented

**Reported**: 2026-01-22
**Severity**: Medium
**Component**: Platform (Engine)

**Description**:
The UNDO command does not emit a `platform.undo_completed` event. The feature appears to be unimplemented.

**Reproduction**:
```
> look
> north
> undo
[no output]
```

**Expected**: Previous game state restored, confirmation message.

**Affected transcripts**: undo-basic.transcript

**Status**: Fixed 2026-02-04 — UNDO was implemented in Jan 2026. Test passes. Snapshot-based restoration working correctly.

### ISSUE-032: Version transcript needs update for DUNGEON name

**Reported**: 2026-01-22
**Severity**: Low
**Component**: Test

**Description**:
The version.transcript test expects "DUNGEO v" but the story was renamed to "DUNGEON" (full spelling). The "DUNGEO" spelling was a nostalgia reference to the PDP-11 era filename limit, but the game title should use the full spelling.

**Resolution**: Update test to expect "DUNGEON" instead of "DUNGEO v".

### ISSUE-047: Zifmia client needs console output panel without full Dev Tools

**Reported**: 2026-02-01
**Severity**: Medium
**Component**: client-zifmia

**Description**:
When debugging issues in the Zifmia client, there is no way to see console output (console.log, console.warn, errors) without enabling the full browser Dev Tools. A lightweight console/log panel built into the Zifmia UI would make debugging much easier.

**Expected**: A toggleable panel in the Zifmia client that displays console output, errors, and warnings without requiring Dev Tools.

---

### ISSUE-048: Zifmia not updated to latest platform

**Reported**: 2026-02-04
**Severity**: Medium
**Component**: client-zifmia

**Description**:
Zifmia client was out of sync with the latest platform build, causing import errors like:

```
The requested module '@sharpee/world-model' does not provide an export named 'StoryInfoTrait'
```

**Resolution**: Rebuild Zifmia after platform changes using `./build.sh -s dungeo -c zifmia` followed by `tauri build` in PowerShell.

**Notes**: This is a workflow reminder - Zifmia's Tauri app must be rebuilt separately after platform/runner changes.
