# Entering Action - Post-Conversion Quality Review

## Action: entering
**Date**: 2025-08-29
**Status**: ✅ Converted to Three-Phase Pattern

## Quality Assessment

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Separation of Concerns | 2/2 | Clean separation: validate (logic), execute (mutations), report (events) |
| Validation Purity | 2/2 | Pure validation with no side effects |
| Event Completeness | 1/2 | Events missing entity information; redundant error fields |
| Error Handling | 0.5/1 | Inconsistent error structure between validation and execution |
| Code Clarity | 0.5/1 | Dead code (unused currentOccupants); misleading comments |
| Type Safety | 0/1 | Uses `(context as any)` hack for state passing |
| Documentation | 1/1 | Well-documented with clear phase descriptions |
| **Total** | **7/10** | Functional but needs improvement |

## Three-Phase Implementation

### ✅ Validate Phase
- Pure validation logic
- Returns ValidationResult
- Comprehensive checks for:
  - Missing target
  - Already inside target
  - Entry trait validation with behaviors
  - Container enterability and openness
  - Supporter enterability
  - Capacity checks

### ✅ Execute Phase
- Returns void (proper three-phase)
- Only performs mutations:
  - Moves actor to target
  - Updates occupants in Entry trait
  - Stores state for report phase
- Uses temporary state pattern `(context as any)._enteringState`

### ✅ Report Phase
- Handles all event generation
- Proper error event structure with `reason` field
- Success events with appropriate prepositions
- ENTERED event for world model updates

## Test Status
- ✅ All 16 tests passing
- ✅ Test helper updated to support three-phase pattern
- 1 test skipped (not related to conversion)

## Code Changes Made
1. **entering.ts**: Already converted in previous session
   - `validate()`: Already good
   - `execute()`: Modified to return void
   - `report()`: New method for event generation
   - Added `reason` field to error events

2. **entering-golden.test.ts**: Updated test helper
   - Modified `executeWithValidation` to support three-phase pattern
   - Handles both old and new patterns for compatibility

## Issues Identified

### Critical Issues
1. **Type Safety**: Using `(context as any)._enteringState` breaks type safety
2. **Redundant Error Fields**: Both `error` and `reason` fields with same value
3. **Dead Code**: `currentOccupants` calculated but never used (line 127-128)
4. **Inconsistent Behavior Usage**: Direct trait mutation instead of using behaviors consistently
5. **Missing Entity Info**: Events don't include actor/target in entities field

### Minor Issues
1. Execution error structure differs from validation error structure
2. Comment says "using behavior" but then directly manipulates data

## Technical Debt
- Using `(context as any)._enteringState` for state passing between phases
- Need proper typed mechanism for phase state transfer
- Should establish consistent error event structure across all actions

## Recommendations
1. Remove redundant error fields (keep only `reason` and `messageId`)
2. Delete unused `currentOccupants` variable
3. Add entities field to all events
4. Create typed state interface for phase communication
5. Use EntryBehavior.addOccupant() method if it exists

## Next Steps
- Fix these issues before moving to next action
- Establish patterns that will be used for all remaining conversions
- Continue with exiting action conversion
- Apply same test helper pattern to other action tests
