# Critical Actions - Detailed Fix Checklists

## Core Assumptions & Requirements

1. **No Backwards Compatibility**: Breaking changes are acceptable for architectural compliance
2. **Three-Phase Architecture**: All actions MUST implement validate/execute/report pattern (ADR-051)
3. **No Debug Statements**: Remove all `console.*` debug statements during refactoring
4. **Iterative Approach**: Complete one action at a time, re-review to confirm 8+ score
5. **Quality Target**: Each refactored action must achieve 8+ rating (up from <5)
