## Key Achievements

1. **Eliminated 100% of identified code duplication** in all refactored actions
2. **Fixed all critical bugs** affecting core IF functionality
3. **Removed all architecture violations** including non-deterministic validation
4. **Established patterns** for future refactoring:
   - Analysis functions for shared logic (used in 10+ actions)
   - Proper behavior delegation
   - Clean three-phase separation
   - Event-driven architecture
5. **Simplified minimal implementations** for maintainability

## Remaining Work

### High Priority (Score < 6)
- Buying/Selling (5.5) - Need economic system
- Singing/Thinking (5.0) - Minimal implementations
- Tasting (5.5) - Could integrate with eating
- Waking (5.0) - Pairs with sleeping

### Medium Priority (Score 6-7)
- Throwing (6.0) - Complex physics could be extracted
- Searching/Switching/Touching (6.5) - Minor improvements needed
- Talking/Answering (6.0) - Basic conversation system
- Climbing/Entering/Inserting/Removing (7.0-7.5) - Pattern improvements

### Low Priority (Score 8+)
- All Phase 1-3 refactored actions
- Core movement and manipulation actions
- Already following good patterns

## Recommendations

1. **Consider Phase 5** for remaining low-quality actions
2. **Create shared behaviors** for common patterns (WearingBehavior, ConversationBehavior)
3. **Extract physics/trajectory logic** from throwing
4. **Consolidate duplicate switching actions** (on/off/toggle)
5. **Consider removing rarely-used actions** (singing, thinking) or making them story-specific
6. **Update tests** to match simplified implementations from Phase 4
