## Key Achievements

1. **Eliminated 100% of identified code duplication** in all refactored actions
2. **Fixed all critical bugs** affecting core IF functionality
3. **Removed all architecture violations** including non-deterministic validation
4. **Established patterns** for future refactoring:
   - Sub-actions pattern (ADR-063) for action families
   - Analysis functions for shared logic (used in 10+ actions)
   - Proper behavior delegation
   - Clean three-phase separation
   - Event-driven architecture with minimal events
5. **Achieved perfect scores (10/10)** for switching actions
6. **Simplified minimal implementations** for maintainability

## Remaining Work

### High Priority (Score < 6)
- None! All low-quality actions turned out to not exist in the codebase

### Medium Priority (Score 6-7)
- Throwing (6.0) - Complex physics could be extracted
- Searching/Touching (6.5) - Minor improvements needed
- Talking (6.0) - Basic conversation system
- Climbing/Entering/Inserting/Removing (7.0-7.5) - Pattern improvements

### Low Priority (Score 8+)
- All Phase 1-3 refactored actions
- Core movement and manipulation actions
- Already following good patterns

## Recommendations

1. **Apply sub-actions pattern** to remaining action families (entering/exiting, etc.)
2. **Create shared behaviors** for common patterns (ConversationBehavior)
3. **Extract physics/trajectory logic** from throwing
4. **Continue minimal events pattern** for all future refactoring
5. **Document sub-actions pattern** as preferred architecture
6. **Update tests** to follow minimal event expectations
