## Recommendations

1. **Continue Phase 3**: Complete remaining sub-actions (3.5-3.8)
2. **Standardize interfaces**: Use IWorldModel consistently
3. **Document patterns**: Create sub-actions implementation guide
4. **Extract common results**: IActionResult base interface
5. **Test utilities**: Create helpers for sub-action testing
6. **Auto-trait pattern**: Document ENTRY trait requirements
