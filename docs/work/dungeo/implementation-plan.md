## Cheat Mechanisms

For an accurate Fortran port, both debug/cheat systems should be implemented.

### GDT (Game Debugging Tool)

Full debug interface with 35 commands in 4 categories:

| Category | Commands | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Alter (9) | AA, AC, AF, AH, AN, AO, AR, AV, AX | `AH` teleport, `AO` move object |
| Display (14) | DA, DC, DF, DH, DL, DM, DN, DO, DP, DR, DS, DT, DV, DX, D2 | `DO` show object, `DR` show room |
| Villain (8) | NC, ND, NR, NT, RC, RD, RR, RT | `ND` immortality, `NR` disable thief |
| Utility (4) | TK, PD, HE, EX | `TK` take any object |

**Authentication**: Challenge-response (version-dependent)
- Early: `SUPNIK,BARNEY,70524` (name, cat's name, badge number)
- Later: `YRUZEV` → `VAX`

See `docs/work/dungeo/gdt-command.md` for full command reference.

### INCANT

Skip directly to endgame:
```
>INCANT <challenge> <response>
```

**Authentication**: ENCRYP algorithm with key `ECORMS`

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| `MHORAM` | `DFNOBO` |
| `DNZHUO` | `IDEQTQ` |

**Effect**: Teleport to Top of Stairs with elvish sword, 15/100 endgame points.

See `docs/work/dungeo/endgame-cheat.md` for full algorithm and Python implementation.
