## Implementation Notes for Sharpee

1. **Treasure tracking:** Need OTVAL (take value) and trophy case value separately
2. **Thief behavior:** Wanders, steals, must open egg, fight difficulty scales with score
3. **Light timer:** Lantern has ~350 turns of light
4. **Puzzle room:** See separate Royal Puzzle spec (8x8 grid)
5. **Robot commands:** Parser must handle "tell robot 'X'" syntax
6. **Endgame separation:** Score resets to 0/100, save disabled
7. **Resurrection:** One-time prayer mechanic
8. **Randomization:** Combat has random elements
