                         WELCOME TO DUNGEON

      DUNGEON is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it you
  will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
  man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors
  contained within!

      In DUNGEON the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets
  of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
  vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by
  fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

      No system should be without one!

      DUNGEON was created at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, by
  Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was
  inspired by the ADVENTURE game of Crowther and Woods, and the long
  tradition of fantasy and science fiction adventure.  DUNGEON is written
  in Sharpee. This version was translated from the paranoid
  FORTRAN implementation by a DEC engineer to Sharpee by a less paranoid
  developer, David Cornelson.

      In-game information may be available using the HELP and INFO
  commands.
