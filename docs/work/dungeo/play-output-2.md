> This is what appears to have been the maintenance room for Flood Control Dam #3, judging by the assortment of tool chests around the room. Apparently, this room has been ransacked recently, for most of the valuable equipment is gone. On the wall in front of you is a panel of buttons, which are labeled in EBCDIC. However, they are of different colors: blue, yellow, brown, and red. The doors to this room are in the west and south ends.

The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your attempts to pass.
