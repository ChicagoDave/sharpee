Welcome to Dungeon. This version created 1-Oct-94.

This is an open field west of a white house with a boarded front door.
There is a small mailbox here.
A rubber mat saying "Welcome to Dungeon!" lies by the door.

> n
> You are facing the north side of a white house. There is no door here, and all the windows are barred.

> e
> You are behind the white house. In one corner of the house there is a small window which is slightly ajar.

> open window
> With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow entry.

> w
> This is the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west, and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward. To the east is a small window which is open.
> On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.
> A bottle is sitting on the table.
> The glass bottle contains:
> A quantity of water.

> w
> This is the living room. There is a door to the east. To the west is a wooden door with strange gothic lettering, which appears to be nailed shut.
> In the center of the room is a large oriental rug.
> There is a trophy case here.
> On hooks above the mantelpiece hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.
> A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.
> There is an issue of US NEWS & DUNGEON REPORT here.

> Above you is an open trap door.
> The door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.

> w
> You try to ascend the ramp, but it is impossible, and you slide back down.

> s
> You are on the west edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be seen. The east side is sheer rock, providing no exits. A narrow passage goes west. The path you are on continues to the north and south.

> s
> This is an art gallery. Most of the paintings which were here have been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste. The vandals left through the north, south, or west exits.
> Fortunately, there is still one chance for you to be a vandal, for on the far wall is a work of unparalleled beauty.

> get painting
> Taken.

> w
> This is the large entrance hall of the Bank of Zork, the largest banking institution of the Great Underground Empire. A partial account of its history is in "The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads" with the chapter on J. Pierpont Flathead. A more detailed history (albeit less objective) may be found in Flathead's outrageous autobiography "I'm Rich and You Aren't -- So There!".
> Most of the furniture has been ravaged by passing scavengers. All that remains are two signs at the northwest and northeast corners of the room, which say

    <-- WEST VIEWING ROOM    EAST VIEWING ROOM -->

> w
> There is a wall there.

> nw
> This is a small square room, which was used by a bank officer whose job it was to retrieve safety deposit boxes for the customer. On the north side of the room is a sign which reads "Viewing Room". On the west side of the room, above an open door, is a sign reading

            BANK PERSONNEL ONLY

> w
> This is a large rectangular room. The east and west walls here were used for storing safety deposit boxes. As might be expected, all have been carefully removed by evil persons. To the east, west, and south of the room are large doorways. The northern "wall" of the room is a shimmering curtain of light. In the center of the room is a large stone cube, about 10 feet on a side. Engraved on the side of the cube is some lettering.
