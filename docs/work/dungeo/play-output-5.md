Welcome to Dungeon. This version created 1-Oct-94.

> This is the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west, and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward. To the east is a small window which is open.

> kill troll with sword

> w
> This is a crawlway with a three foot high ceiling. Your footing is very unsure here due to the assortment of rocks underfoot. Passages can be seen in the east, west, and northwest corners of the crawlway.

> e
> This is the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling of another room below. Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a wooden railing which circles the dome.

> tie rope to railing
> The rope drops over the side and comes within ten feet of the floor.

> d
> This is a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down staircase. To the west is a narrow twisting tunnel, covered with a thin layer of dust. Above you is a large dome painted with scenes depicting elfin hacking rites. Up around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing. In the center of the room there is a white marble pedestal.

> This is what appears to have been an artist's studio. The walls and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors. Strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here. At the north and northwest of the room are open doors (also covered with paint). An extremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace. Although you might be able to get up the chimney, it seems unlikely that you could get back down.

> nw
> This is an art gallery. Most of the paintings which were here have been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste. The vandals left through the north, south, or west exits.

> In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged somewhere by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and has a delicate looking clasp holding it closed. The egg appears extremely fragile.

To Whom It May Concern:

I regret to report that the rumours regarding treasure contained in the chamber to which this passage leads have no basis in fact. Should you nevertheless be sufficiently foolhardy to enter, it will be quite impossible for you to exit.

                Sincerely yours,
                The Thief

The architecture of this region is getting complex, so that further descriptions will be diagrams of the immediate vicinity in a 3x3 grid. The walls here are rock, but of two different types -- sandstone and marble. The following notations will be used:

            ..  = current position (middle of grid)
            MM  = marble wall
            SS  = sandstone wall

    !!!! FROBOZZ MAGIC ROBOT COMPANY !!!!

Hello, master!

I am a late-model robot, trained at MIT Tech to perform various simple housekeeping functions.

Instructions for use:

To activate me, use the following formula --
TELL ROBOT "something to do"
The quotation marks are mandatory.

Warranty:

No warranty is expressed or implied.

At your service!

> This is a large room full of assorted heavy machinery. The room smells of burned resistors. The room is noisy from the whirring sounds of the machines. Along one wall of the room are three buttons which are, respectively, round, triangular, and square. Naturally, above the buttons are instructions written in EBCDIC. A large sign above all the buttons says in English:

            DANGER: HIGH VOLTAGE

There are exits to the west and the south.

> This is a dingy closet adjacent to the machine room. On one wall is a small sticker which reads:

        Protected by
          FROBOZZ
         Magic Alarm Company
          (Hello, footpad!).

There is a beautiful white crystal sphere here.

> get sphere
> As you reach for the sphere, a steel cage falls from the ceiling to entrap you. To make matters worse, poisonous gas starts coming into the room.
> Time passes... and you die from some obscure poisoning.
> As you take your last breath, you feel relieved of your burdens. The feeling passes as you find yourself before the gates of Hell, where the spirits jeer at you and deny you entry. Your senses are disturbed. The objects in the dungeon appear indistinct, bleached of color, even unreal.
