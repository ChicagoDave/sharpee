## Summary
Brief description of what the action does

## Implementation Analysis
- Does the action have validate/execute/report/blocked phases?
- Does execute phase actually mutate world state (if applicable)?
- Are events emitted correctly?

## Test Coverage Analysis
- List all test cases that exist
- Are all four phases tested?
- Is world state mutation verified (not just messages)?
- Are edge cases covered?

## Gaps Identified
- What's NOT being tested that should be?
- Specifically: are there tests that verify actual world state after execution?

## Recommendations
Specific test cases to add

## Risk Level
HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW - based on likelihood of bugs like the dropping bug going undetected
