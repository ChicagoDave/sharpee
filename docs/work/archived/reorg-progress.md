# Documentation Reorganization Progress

**Date**: 2025-08-06  
**Session**: Documentation consolidation and organization

## Summary

Successfully reorganized the Sharpee documentation from scattered locations into a centralized, well-structured `/docs/` directory.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Phase 1: Directory Structure
- Created complete `/docs/` directory hierarchy
- Established clear organization for all documentation types
- Created subdirectories for architecture, development, API, packages, features, and maintenance

### ✅ Phase 2: Architectural Documentation
- Moved all ADRs from `/decisions/` to `/docs/architecture/adrs/`
  - Core system ADRs preserved in subdirectory
  - Batch reviews organized
  - Outdated ADRs archived but accessible
- Moved design documents from `/design/` to `/docs/architecture/design/`
  - Diagrams organized in separate subdirectory
  - Build scripts preserved

### ✅ Phase 3: Development Documentation
- Moved CI/CD documentation from `/cicd/` to `/docs/development/setup/`
  - Quick start checklist
  - Setup guide
  - Workflow templates

### ✅ Phase 4: Feature Documentation
- Moved feature proposals from `/features/` to `/docs/features/`
- Preserved parser enhancement subdirectory structure

### ✅ Phase 5: Maintenance Documentation
- Moved cleanup tasks from `/cleanup-needed/` to `/docs/maintenance/cleanup/`
- Moved fix documentation from `/fix-action-tests/` to `/docs/maintenance/fixes/`
- Organized scripts in separate subdirectory

### ✅ Documentation Indexes
Created comprehensive README indexes for:
- `/docs/README.md` - Main documentation hub
- `/docs/architecture/README.md` - Architecture documentation index
- `/docs/architecture/adrs/README.md` - ADR index with categorization
- `/docs/development/README.md` - Development guide index
- `/docs/packages/README.md` - Package documentation index
- `/docs/api/README.md` - API reference index
- `/docs/features/README.md` - Feature documentation index
- `/docs/maintenance/README.md` - Maintenance documentation index

### ✅ Cleanup
- Removed empty directories: `/decisions/`, `/design/`, `/cicd/`, `/features/`, `/cleanup-needed/`, `/fix-action-tests/`
- Preserved all content in new locations
- Maintained directory structure where appropriate

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Single Source of Truth** - All documentation now in `/docs/`
2. **Clear Hierarchy** - Logical organization by type and purpose
3. **Better Discoverability** - Easy navigation with comprehensive indexes
4. **Improved Maintenance** - Clear where new documentation should go
5. **Professional Structure** - Industry-standard documentation organization

## Statistics

- **Directories created**: 25+
- **Files moved**: 100+
- **Indexes created**: 8
- **Old directories removed**: 6

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- [ ] Update cross-references in moved documents
- [ ] Verify all links still work
- [ ] Update root README to reference new structure

### Future
- [ ] Add search functionality
- [ ] Generate API documentation automatically
- [ ] Create documentation templates
- [ ] Set up documentation CI/CD

## File Movement Map

| Old Location | New Location |
|--------------|--------------|
| `/decisions/` | `/docs/architecture/adrs/` |
| `/design/` | `/docs/architecture/design/` |
| `/cicd/` | `/docs/development/setup/` |
| `/features/` | `/docs/features/` |
| `/cleanup-needed/` | `/docs/maintenance/cleanup/` |
| `/fix-action-tests/` | `/docs/maintenance/fixes/` |

## Impact

This reorganization provides a solid foundation for:
- New developer onboarding
- Documentation maintenance
- Future documentation growth
- Automated documentation generation
- Documentation versioning

The new structure follows industry best practices and makes the Sharpee project more professional and approachable for contributors.
