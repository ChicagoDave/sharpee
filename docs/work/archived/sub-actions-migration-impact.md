# Migration Impact Assessment: Sub-Actions Pattern

## Executive Summary

Migration to sub-actions pattern is **low-risk** with **high reward**. The impact is primarily contained to the stdlib package with minimal external changes needed.

## Impact Analysis

### 1. File System Changes

**Actions to Migrate (6 pairs = 12 actions):**
```
Current: 12 action directories + 3 shared files = 15 top-level items
New: 6 action family directories = 6 top-level items
```

**Files Affected:**
- 36 action files (3 per action × 12 actions)
- 3 shared files (to be relocated)
- 1 index file (actions/standard/index.ts)
- 0 external files (no imports outside stdlib)

### 2. Import Impact

**Internal to stdlib:**
- Tests import from '@sharpee/stdlib' package exports
- No direct file imports found
- Actions reference each other via IFActions constants, not imports

**External packages:**
```bash
# Searched for direct imports - NONE FOUND
grep -r "from.*switching_on" packages/engine  # No results
grep -r "from.*switching_off" packages/parser # No results
```

**Conclusion:** Import changes are isolated to stdlib's internal index.ts

### 3. Testing Impact

**Test Structure:**
```
tests/unit/actions/
├── switching_on-golden.test.ts
├── switching_off-golden.test.ts
└── ... other tests
```

Tests import via package exports:
```typescript
import { switchingOnAction } from '@sharpee/stdlib';
```

**Required Changes:** NONE - tests remain unchanged

### 4. Parser/Engine Integration

**How actions are referenced:**
```typescript
// In parser
const actionId = IFActions.SWITCHING_ON;  // String constant
const action = actionRegistry.get(actionId);

// In engine
if (action.id === IFActions.SWITCHING_ON) { }
```

**Required Changes:** NONE - ID-based references unchanged

### 5. Build System Impact

**TypeScript Compilation:**
- Path mappings via tsconfig already handle '@sharpee/stdlib'
- No hardcoded paths found

**Bundle Size:**
- No change - same code, different organization
- Tree-shaking works identically

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Factors ✅

1. **No Breaking Changes**
   - External API unchanged
   - Action IDs unchanged
   - Export names unchanged

2. **Isolated Scope**
   - Changes contained to stdlib/src/actions/standard/
   - No ripple effects to other packages

3. **Incremental Migration**
   - Can migrate one pair at a time
   - Old and new can coexist temporarily

4. **Easy Rollback**
   - Git history preserves old structure
   - Can revert per-pair if issues arise

### Potential Risks ⚠️

1. **Developer Workflow**
   - Risk: Confusion during transition
   - Mitigation: Clear documentation, migrate quickly

2. **IDE Navigation**
   - Risk: Deeper nesting might slow navigation
   - Mitigation: Better organization actually improves discovery

3. **Merge Conflicts**
   - Risk: Active PRs might conflict
   - Mitigation: Coordinate with team, migrate after current PRs

## Migration Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1)
- Create migration script
- Set up parallel structure for switching
- Validate tests pass

### Phase 2: Pilot (Day 1-2)
- Migrate switching_on/off
- Update documentation
- Team review

### Phase 3: Bulk Migration (Day 2-3)
- Migrate remaining 5 pairs
- Run full test suite
- Update all documentation

### Phase 4: Cleanup (Day 3)
- Remove old directories
- Remove shared files
- Final validation

**Total Time:** 3 days (can be done faster if needed)

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Migration Costs
- **Developer Time:** ~16 hours total
- **Review Time:** ~4 hours
- **Documentation:** ~2 hours
- **Total:** ~22 hours (2-3 days)

### Long-term Benefits
- **Reduced Confusion:** -2 hours/month (clearer structure)
- **Faster Development:** -1 hour per new paired action
- **Fewer Bugs:** -1 hour/month (better organization)
- **Easier Onboarding:** -2 hours per new developer

**Break-even:** 3-4 months

## Implementation Checklist

### Pre-Migration
- [ ] Ensure all tests passing
- [ ] Document current structure
- [ ] Communicate with team
- [ ] Create migration branch

### During Migration
- [ ] Create sub-action structure for switching
- [ ] Migrate switching_on/off as pilot
- [ ] Validate all tests pass
- [ ] Get team approval
- [ ] Migrate remaining pairs
- [ ] Update exports in index.ts
- [ ] Run full test suite

### Post-Migration
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Remove old directories
- [ ] Create ADR for pattern
- [ ] Train team on new structure
- [ ] Monitor for issues

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. **Immediate:** Revert the index.ts export changes
2. **Short-term:** Keep both structures, fix issues
3. **Long-term:** If pattern doesn't work, revert fully

Rollback time: < 1 hour

## Decision Matrix

| Factor | Shared Files | Sub-Actions | Winner |
|--------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Code Organization | 6/10 | 9/10 | Sub-Actions |
| Discoverability | 5/10 | 9/10 | Sub-Actions |
| Migration Effort | 10/10 | 7/10 | Shared Files |
| Long-term Maintenance | 6/10 | 9/10 | Sub-Actions |
| Scalability | 5/10 | 9/10 | Sub-Actions |
| Type Safety | 7/10 | 8/10 | Sub-Actions |
| **Total** | **39/60** | **51/60** | **Sub-Actions** |

## Conclusion

The migration to sub-actions is:
- **Low risk** - Isolated changes with no external impact
- **High value** - Significant improvement in organization
- **Quick to implement** - 2-3 days total effort
- **Easy to validate** - Existing tests ensure correctness
- **Simple to rollback** - If needed, can revert quickly

**Recommendation:** Proceed with migration starting with switching actions as pilot.
