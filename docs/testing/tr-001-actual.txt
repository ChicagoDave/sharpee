This is the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west, and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward. To the east is a small window which is open.
On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.
A bottle is sitting on the table.
The glass bottle contains:
  A quantity of water.

This is the living room. There is a door to the east. To the west is a wooden door with strange gothic lettering, which appears to be nailed shut.
In the center of the room is a large oriental rug.
There is a trophy case here.
On hooks above the mantelpiece hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.
A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.
There is an issue of US NEWS & DUNGEON REPORT here.
