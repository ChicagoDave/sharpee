# Stdlib Test Assessment - 2025-07-28

## Summary
- **Total Test Files**: 143
- **Failed**: 42 test files
- **Passed**: 101 test files
- **Success Rate**: 70.6%

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Test Utilities Not Updated
The test utilities in `/packages/stdlib/tests/test-utils/index.ts` are still using the old context implementation that was refactored in Phase 2:

1. **Import Error**: Tests are importing `EnhancedActionContextImpl` which no longer exists (renamed to `InternalActionContext` and made private)
2. **Type Mismatch**: Tests expect `EnhancedActionContext` return type but should use `ActionContext`
3. **Factory Pattern**: Tests should use the new `createActionContext` factory function instead of directly instantiating the class

### Error Pattern
```
TypeError: actionId.split is not a function
 ‚ùØ createCommand tests/test-utils/index.ts:144:41
```

This error appears to be a secondary issue caused by the context creation failing and passing incorrect data types.

## Affected Test Categories

### 1. Action Tests (Most Affected)
All golden test files for actions are failing due to the context creation issue:
- `inventory-golden.test.ts` (15/18 failed)
- `smelling-golden.test.ts` (17/23 failed)
- `looking-golden.test.ts` (13/18 failed)
- `giving-golden.test.ts` (18/21 failed)
- `drinking-golden.test.ts` (26/33 failed)
- `attacking-golden.test.ts` (24/33 failed)
- `throwing-golden.test.ts` (23/33 failed)
- `entering-golden.test.ts` (12/17 failed)
- `switching_on-golden.test.ts` (17/25 failed)
- `switching_off-golden.test.ts` (17/25 failed)
- And many more...

### 2. Passing Tests
Tests that don't rely on the enhanced context creation are passing:
- Action metadata tests (checking ID, messages, group)
- Pattern validation tests
- Registry tests
- Some utility tests

## Fix Strategy

### Immediate Fix Required
Update `/packages/stdlib/tests/test-utils/index.ts`:

1. **Update imports**:
   ```typescript
   // Remove:
   import { EnhancedActionContext, EnhancedActionContextImpl } from '../../src/actions/enhanced-context';
   
   // Add:
   import { createActionContext } from '../../src/actions/enhanced-context';
   import { ActionContext } from '../../src/actions/enhanced-types';
   ```

2. **Update `createRealTestContext` function**:
   ```typescript
   export function createRealTestContext(
     action: Action,
     world: WorldModel,
     command: ValidatedCommand
   ): ActionContext {  // Changed return type
     // ... existing validation code ...
     
     // Use factory function instead of class constructor
     return createActionContext(world, player, action, command);
   }
   ```

3. **Update any other test utilities** that reference `EnhancedActionContext`

### Additional Considerations

1. **Test Expectations**: Some tests may need updating if they expect specific properties or methods that were on `EnhancedActionContext` but not on the unified `ActionContext`

2. **Mock Functions**: The `createMockEnhancedContext` function was already renamed to `createMockActionContext` in the main code, but test files may need updating to use the new name

3. **Type Assertions**: Any type assertions or casts to `EnhancedActionContext` in tests need to be updated

## Impact Assessment

- **High Priority**: This is blocking all action behavior tests
- **Low Risk Fix**: The fix is straightforward - update imports and function calls
- **No Production Impact**: Only test code is affected
- **Quick Resolution**: Should take less than 30 minutes to fix

## Recommendation

1. **Immediate Action**: Update test utilities to use the new context pattern
2. **Verify**: Run tests again to ensure the primary issue is resolved
3. **Follow-up**: Address any remaining test failures that may be due to actual behavior changes
4. **Document**: Update test documentation to reflect the new patterns

This appears to be a straightforward case of test infrastructure not being updated alongside the production code changes in Phase 2. The good news is that the production code itself appears to be working correctly - it's just the tests that need updating to match the new architecture.
