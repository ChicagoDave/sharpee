# Phase 3 Final Progress Report - Event Structure Standardization

## Overall Test Progress
- **Starting point**: 118 failed tests, 42 failed test files
- **Current status**: 96 failed tests, 29 failed test files  
- **Total fixed**: 22 tests (18.6% improvement)
- **Passed tests**: 2,595

## Actions Successfully Fixed

### 1. Inventory Action ✅
- **Tests fixed**: ~10 tests
- **Key fix**: Domain event double-wrapping issue in enhanced-context.ts
- **Status**: 17/18 tests passing

### 2. Opening Action ✅  
- **Tests fixed**: 3 tests
- **Key fix**: Added backward compatibility 'item' field
- **Status**: 11/15 tests passing (4 failures remain)

### 3. Giving Action ✅
- **Tests fixed**: 4 tests
- **Key fixes**: 
  - Added missing 'reason' field to error events
  - Fixed test setup issue with invalid trait
- **Status**: All 21 tests passing

### 4. Looking Action ✅
- **Tests fixed**: 4 tests
- **Key fixes**:
  - Combined multiple success events into one
  - Fixed currentLocation to use immediate container
  - Preserved special location message IDs
- **Status**: All 18 tests passing

## Remaining High-Priority Actions

Based on the test log, these actions still need fixes:

1. **Smelling action** - 1 failure (too_far messageId issue)
2. **Entering action** - 1 failure (already inside check)
3. **Opening action** - 4 remaining failures (empty container, revealing contents)
4. **Talking action** - 2 failures (conversation topics detection)
5. **Searching action** - 3 failures (concealed items)
6. **Pulling/Pushing actions** - 3 failures each
7. **Wearing action** - Multiple failures

## Key Technical Discoveries

### 1. Domain Event Structure
The core issue was domain events (if.*) being wrapped twice, causing:
```
// Before: event.data.data.items
// After: event.data.items
```

### 2. Context Location Handling
Actions need immediate location (container/supporter), not containing room:
```typescript
// Fixed to use immediate location
const locationId = world.getLocation(player.id);
const currentLocation = locationId ? world.getEntity(locationId) : null;
```

### 3. Test Event Expectations
Many tests expect specific event structures that require:
- Backward compatibility fields
- Specific parameter combinations
- Single success events instead of multiple

## Recommendations for Next Phase

1. **Continue fixing remaining actions** following established patterns
2. **Document event structure standards** for future actions
3. **Update test utilities** to handle new event patterns
4. **Create migration guide** for updating old tests

## Success Metrics
- Reduced test failures by 18.6%
- Fixed 13 test files completely
- Established clear patterns for fixing remaining tests
- Improved understanding of event architecture
