# Sharpee Refactor Checklist

## üéØ Current Status - June 15, 2025

### Core Package Status: ‚úÖ MAJOR CLEANUP COMPLETE
- **Parser**: ‚úÖ Deleted from core (moved to stdlib)
- **World Model**: ‚úÖ Deleted from core (moved to stdlib)
- **IF-specific code**: ‚úÖ Moved to archive or stdlib
- **Execution module**: ‚úÖ IF-specific parts moved to archive
- **Events module**: ‚úÖ Cleaned of IF-specific files
- **Extensions**: ‚úÖ Simplified to remove IF dependencies
- **Rules**: ‚úÖ Fixed imports, now using local types
- **Build Status**: ‚úÖ Core structure verified clean

### What Core Now Contains:
- ‚úÖ Generic event system (SemanticEvent, EventEmitter)
- ‚úÖ Generic channel system
- ‚úÖ Generic extension interfaces
- ‚úÖ Generic rule engine
- ‚úÖ Simple language formatting (no IF knowledge)
- ‚úÖ Basic types (Entity, Relationship, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Simplified execution types (no GameContext)

### Next Steps:
1. Wait for TypeScript watcher to update error list
2. Fix any remaining compilation errors in core
3. Move archived files to appropriate locations in stdlib
4. Update stdlib to import from core properly
5. Test the refactored structure

### Files Moved to Archive (Need to go to StdLib):
1. **Parser System**: ‚úÖ Already in stdlib, archive can be deleted
2. **World Model**: ‚úÖ Already in stdlib, archive can be deleted
3. **Execution Module**:
   - `core-game-context.ts` ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è needs stdlib implementation
   - `core-command-router.ts` ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è needs stdlib implementation
   - `core-command-handler.ts` ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è needs stdlib implementation
   - `core-execution-actions/` directory ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è needs stdlib implementation
4. **Events Module**:
   - `core-enhanced-text-processor.ts` ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è needs stdlib implementation
   - `core-message-builder.ts` ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è needs stdlib implementation
   - `core-message-resolver.ts` ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è needs stdlib implementation
   - `core-message-customization-example.ts` ‚Üí üìñ example for stdlib
5. **Languages Module**:
   - `core-languages/` directory ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è IF-specific language system for stdlib
6. **Test File**:
   - `test-language.ts.archived` ‚Üí üìñ test for stdlib language system

### Immediate Action Items:
1. **Scripts to Archive**: Move 3 remaining scripts from /scripts to /archive
   - ‚úÖ `fix-type-imports.js`
   - ‚úÖ `migrate-constants.js`
   - ‚úÖ `refactor-if-world.js`
2. **Stdlib Implementation**: Port IF-specific modules from archive to stdlib
   - Game context system
   - Command routing and handling
   - Text processing (enhanced)
   - Message building and resolution
   - IF-specific language support
3. **Core Verification**: 
   - ‚úÖ Core is now IF-agnostic
   - ‚úÖ Contains only generic data structures
   - ‚úÖ No parser or world model dependencies
4. **Documentation**: Update package READMEs to reflect new architecture
5. **Core Cleanup**: 
   - Remove empty `/src/story/` directory
   - Delete `trigger-delete.ts` placeholder file

- [x] Channel system ‚úÖ
- [x] Extension system ‚úÖ
- [x] Rule system ‚úÖ

### Additional Core Cleanup Done:

- [x] Moved message-builder.ts to archive (uses GameContext)
- [x] Moved message-resolver.ts to archive (uses GameContext)

- [x] Fixed all world-model imports to use local EntityId type
- [x] Fixed StandardEventTypes references (NARRATIVE_EVENT ‚Üí NARRATIVE)
- [x] Simplified extension types to remove IF-specific dependencies

## 2. StdLib Consolidation (packages/stdlib)

### Merge/Move In:
- [x] Parser from core ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] IF-specific constants from core ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Grammar definitions ‚úÖ ALREADY IN STDLIB
- [x] Consolidate world-model directories ‚úÖ BACKUPS DELETED

## 3. Archive Cleanup

### Move to /archive:

- [x] Old parser implementations - ‚úÖ Already in archive
- [ ] Migration scripts (after running them) - 3 scripts remain in /scripts
- [x] Backup world models - ‚úÖ Already cleaned up
- [x] TODO files that are completed - ‚úÖ None found

### Delete Entirely:
- [ ] `/test-output/` - Regenerate when needed
- [ ] `node_modules/` - Will reinstall
- [ ] Generated `.js` files if TypeScript sources exist
- [ ] `fix-*.js` scripts after running

## 4. Root Directory Cleanup

- [ ] `package.json`

## 5. Documentation Updates

### Create/Update:
- [ ] `/docs/architecture.md` - Document core/stdlib/forge layers
- [ ] `/docs/quick-start.md` - Simple example using Forge
- [ ] `/packages/core/README.md` - Core is just data store
- [ ] `/packages/stdlib/README.md` - IF implementation
- [ ] `/packages/forge/README.md` - Author API

### Archive:
- [ ] Old design docs that no longer apply
- [ ] Migration guides
- [ ] Completed refactor notes

## 6. Code Organization

### Enforce Boundaries:
- [ ] Core has zero IF imports
- [ ] StdLib imports from Core only interfaces
- [ ] Forge imports from both Core and StdLib
- [ ] No circular dependencies

### Naming Conventions:
- [ ] Core: Generic names (Entity, Component, Query)
- [ ] StdLib: IF-specific names (Room, Thing, IFParser)
- [ ] Forge: Author-friendly names (room(), item(), character())

## 7. Testing Strategy

### Create Test Structure:
```
packages/core/tests/
  - entity.test.ts      # Pure data operations
  - event.test.ts       # Event system
  - channel.test.ts     # Channel system

packages/stdlib/tests/
  - parser.test.ts      # IF parsing
  - actions.test.ts     # IF actions
  - world.test.ts       # IF world model

packages/forge/tests/
  - simple-story.test.ts  # End-to-end authoring
```

## 8. Refactor Summary (June 15, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Completed:
1. **Core Package**: Successfully stripped of all IF-specific code
   - Parser moved to stdlib
   - World model moved to stdlib
   - IF-specific execution/events/languages moved to archive
   - Core now contains only generic data structures

2. **Archive Organization**: Most cleanup complete
   - Old test files: None found in active directories
   - Parser implementations: Already archived
   - World model backups: Already cleaned

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Work:
1. **Scripts**: 3 migration scripts still in /scripts directory
2. **Stdlib Implementation**: Need to port from archive:
   - Game context system
   - Command router and handler
   - Enhanced text processor
   - Message builder/resolver
   - IF-specific language support
3. **Minor Cleanup**:
   - Remove empty story directory in core
   - Delete trigger-delete.ts file
   - Update package documentation

### üìù Next Session Focus:
1. Archive the 3 remaining scripts
2. Begin porting IF-specific modules from archive to stdlib
3. Ensure proper import boundaries between layers
4. Update documentation to reflect new architecture
