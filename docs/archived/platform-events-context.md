# Platform Events Implementation Context

## Previous Session Summary
We identified and designed a solution for handling platform operations (save, restore, quit, restart) that require client/host intervention. The key insight was that actions were trying to perform async operations during turn execution, which violates the core principle that "all text is sent through events to an event source data store and after a turn is completed (all world model changes are completed) a text service uses templates."

## Solution Design
We designed a platform event system where:
1. Actions emit semantic events indicating platform operations are requested
2. The engine queues these during turn execution  
3. After turn completion but before text service, the engine processes platform operations
4. Platform operations emit completion events
5. Text service then runs and can report on what happened

## Key Files Created/Updated
- `decisions/adr-035-platform-event-architecture.md` - Documents the architecture decision
- `platform-events-checklist.md` - Comprehensive implementation checklist
- Fixed build errors in `@sharpee/stdlib` package:
  - `again.ts` - Type casting issue
  - `saving.ts` - Removed async, needs platform event emission
  - `sleeping.ts` - Fixed method name
  - `quit-handler.ts` - Fixed query type comparison

## Next Steps
Start implementing platform events following the checklist in `platform-events-checklist.md`. The recommended order is:

1. **Phase 1**: Create platform event types in `@sharpee/core`
2. **Phase 2**: Update GameEngine to handle platform operations
3. **Phase 3**: Update save/restore actions to emit platform events
4. **Phase 4**: Test the implementation

## Current State
- The build is failing due to missing `@sharpee/if-domain` dependency in `lang-en-us` (already fixed)
- The stdlib package has build errors that were partially fixed
- The saving action still needs to be updated to use platform events instead of async operations

## Working Directory
Root: `C:\repotemp\sharpee`
Key packages:
- `/packages/core` - Where platform event types go
- `/packages/engine` - Where platform operation handling goes  
- `/packages/stdlib` - Where actions need updating

## Development Notes
- Using pnpm for package management
- Tests go in `/tests` within each package
- Following the "no virtual machine" and "query-able world model" principles
- All code changes should be discussed for design issues first

## Prompt for Next Session
"Let's implement platform events for the Sharpee IF engine. We need to update the save/restore/quit/restart actions to emit platform events instead of trying to perform async operations directly. The platform-events-checklist.md has the implementation plan. Should we start with Phase 1 - creating the platform event types in core?"
