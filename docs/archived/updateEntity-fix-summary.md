# UpdateEntity Fix Summary

## Date: June 30, 2025

## Overview
Fixed build failures caused by missing `updateEntity` method and related type issues discovered during Phase 3.7 refactoring.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added updateEntity to WorldModel Interface
**File:** `packages/world-model/src/world/WorldModel.interface.ts`
- Added `updateEntity(entityId: string, updater: (entity: IFEntity) => void): void;`
- Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation with example usage

### 2. Implemented updateEntity in WorldModelImpl
**File:** `packages/world-model/src/world/WorldModel.ts`
- Implemented the method with proper error handling
- Respects `strictMode` configuration
- Includes comment for future reactive system support

### 3. Fixed Type Annotations in Event Handlers
**File:** `packages/event-processor/src/handlers/movement.ts`
- Added `IFEntity` type import
- Fixed all arrow function parameters to include `: IFEntity` type annotation
- Removed unnecessary `return entity` statements
- Changed from creating new trait instances to direct mutation

**File:** `packages/event-processor/src/handlers/state-change.ts`
- Added `IFEntity` type import
- Fixed all arrow function parameters to include `: IFEntity` type annotation
- Removed unnecessary `return entity` statements
- Changed from creating new trait instances to direct mutation

### 4. Fixed Direct Trait Mutations
Changed pattern from:
```typescript
entity.add(new WearableTrait({ ...wearableTrait, worn: false }));
```

To direct mutation:
```typescript
wearableTrait.worn = false;
```

This aligns with the design decision that traits are mutable for runtime entity creation.

### 5. Fixed Missing Exports
**File:** `packages/stdlib/src/messages/message-keys.ts`
- Added re-export of `getMessage` and `messageResolver` from `'./message-resolver'`

### 6. PartOfSpeech Type
- No changes needed - 'preposition' already exists in the enum as `PREPOSITION = 'preposition'`

## Design Decisions

1. **Traits are mutable** - This is by design to support dynamic entity creation at runtime
2. **updateEntity is a convenience wrapper** - It provides a clean API for entity mutations
3. **Direct mutation pattern** - Event handlers should mutate traits directly, not create new instances
4. **Future extensibility** - The implementation includes a comment for future reactive system support

## Next Steps

1. Run the build to confirm all issues are resolved
2. Complete Phase 3.7 steps 9-10 (Build and Test, Migration and Cleanup)
3. Move to Phase 5: Update Engine with three-phase command processing
4. Create integration tests for the full pipeline

## Benefits

- Cleaner API for entity updates
- Better performance (no unnecessary object creation)
- Aligns with the mutable design philosophy
- Prepares for future reactive systems
