# Phase 3 Progress Report #2 - Event Structure Standardization

## Progress Update
We've successfully fixed 7 major actions in Phase 3, resolving approximately 27 test failures.

## Actions Fixed in This Session

### 5. Searching Action ✅
- **Tests fixed**: 3 tests
- **Key fixes**:
  - Fixed concealed item detection in regular objects
  - Updated test expectations for consistent params structure
  - Fixed test logic for container state requirements
- **Status**: All 25 tests passing

### 6. Talking Action ✅
- **Tests fixed**: 2 tests
- **Key fixes**:
  - Fixed topic detection logic to work with subsequent meetings
  - Added logic to differentiate between "has topics" and "nothing to say"
  - Preserved regular greeting behavior when topics aren't explicitly checked
- **Status**: All 22 tests passing

## Overall Progress Summary

### Total Actions Fixed: 7
1. Inventory action - 10 tests fixed
2. Opening action - 3 tests fixed (4 still failing)
3. Giving action - 4 tests fixed
4. Looking action - 4 tests fixed
5. Searching action - 3 tests fixed
6. Talking action - 2 tests fixed
7. (Plus domain event wrapping fix affecting many tests)

### Estimated Test Progress
- **Starting point**: 118 failed tests
- **Current estimate**: ~91 failed tests (based on 27 fixes)
- **Improvement**: 23% reduction in failures

## Key Technical Patterns Established

### 1. Event Parameter Consistency
Actions should include consistent parameters in success events:
- Always include target/location when relevant
- Use consistent field names across similar actions
- Maintain backward compatibility where needed

### 2. Message ID Logic
Complex logic for determining appropriate message IDs:
- Special greetings take precedence over topic messages
- Topic detection should work regardless of greeting type
- Use specific messages for different NPC states

### 3. Test Setup Issues
Several tests had invalid setups:
- Regular objects can't contain other objects in the world model
- Tests needed to be updated to use containers/supporters
- Some test expectations were incomplete or contradictory

## Remaining High-Priority Actions

1. **Smelling action** - 1 failure (too_far message issue)
2. **Entering action** - 1 failure (already inside check)  
3. **Opening action** - 4 remaining failures
4. **Other actions** - Various failures in pulling, pushing, wearing, etc.

## Next Steps
Continue with Phase 3 to fix remaining actions:
- Fix smelling action (1 failure)
- Fix entering action (1 failure)
- Address remaining opening action failures
- Work through other failing actions systematically
