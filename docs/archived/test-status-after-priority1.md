# Test Status After Priority 1 Fixes

## Summary
- **Total Tests**: ~450+
- **Passing**: ~300+ (significant improvement)
- **Failing**: ~150 (down from 300+)
- **Main Issues**: Implementation bugs, not infrastructure

## âœ… Infrastructure Fixed
1. **World Model** - Entity creation, movement, and containment working correctly
2. **Shared Data** - Platform actions now using capability system
3. **Command Creation** - Helper function handles undefined entities properly
4. **Test Utils** - Added necessary helper functions

## ðŸ”§ Remaining Issues by Category

### 1. **Message ID Mismatches** (~40% of failures)
Tests expecting partial matches but actions emit exact IDs:
```typescript
// Test expects:
expect.stringContaining('accepted')
// Action emits:
'if.action.answering.answered_yes'
```

### 2. **Missing Event Data Fields** (~30% of failures)
Actions not populating expected event data:
- `toContainer`/`toSupporter` flags
- `expectedAnswer` field
- `items` array in inventory
- Various boolean flags

### 3. **Action Logic Issues** (~20% of failures)
- Reachability checks not working as expected
- Topic parsing extracting wrong values
- Concealment detection not implemented
- Auto-detection of container/supporter not working

### 4. **Test Setup Issues** (~10% of failures)
- Some tests not setting up player correctly
- Migration examples using old patterns
- Entity reference expectations

## Next Priority Actions

### Priority 2A: Fix Message ID Tests
Update tests to expect exact message IDs instead of partial matches.

### Priority 2B: Fix Event Data Population
Update action implementations to include all expected event data fields.

### Priority 2C: Fix Action Logic
Implement missing features like concealment detection and auto-detection.

### Priority 2D: Fix Remaining Test Setup
Update migration examples and fix remaining setup issues.

## Key Improvements Made
- Platform tests now passing (were all failing)
- Listening tests all passing (were failing)
- Many tests now show specific errors instead of infrastructure failures
- Error messages are more informative
- Core world model operations working correctly

The infrastructure is now solid. Remaining failures are implementation details that can be fixed systematically.
