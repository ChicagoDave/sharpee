# Cloak of Darkness Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the work done to implement the Cloak of Darkness story on the Sharpee IF Platform, including the challenges encountered and solutions implemented.

## Key Implementation Steps

### 1. Story Structure Setup
- Created `/stories/cloak-of-darkness/` with proper TypeScript structure
- Implemented `CloakOfDarknessStory` class implementing the `Story` interface
- Set up rooms: Foyer, Cloakroom, Bar, and Outside
- Created entities: velvet cloak, brass hook, message in sawdust

### 2. Custom Vocabulary Registration
The main challenge was enabling the "hang" verb, which isn't part of the standard library.

#### Design Decision: Parser Extension API
We chose Option 2 (Parser Extension) over Option 1 (Story-defined Parser) for dynamic vocabulary:
- Stories can register custom verbs at runtime
- Parser remains centralized but extensible
- Vocabulary registry handles priority and conflicts

#### Implementation:
1. Added to `Story` interface:
   ```typescript
   getCustomVocabulary?(): CustomVocabulary;
   ```

2. Added to `Parser` interface:
   ```typescript
   registerVerbs?(verbs: VerbVocabulary[]): void;
   ```

3. Story registers "hang" verb:
   ```typescript
   getCustomVocabulary() {
     return {
       verbs: [{
         actionId: 'HANG',
         verbs: ['hang', 'hook'],
         pattern: 'VERB_NOUN_PREP_NOUN'
       }]
     };
   }
   ```

### 3. Platform Event System
When "hang cloak on hook" failed with "You can't see any cloak on hook here", we discovered the parser was treating "cloak on hook" as a single noun phrase.

#### Solution: Platform Events for Debugging
Implemented a separate event system for platform/debug events:

1. **Architecture**:
   - Game events: Story actions and state changes
   - Platform events: Debug info from parser, world model, etc.
   - Uses `SemanticEventSource` from `@sharpee/core`

2. **Implementation**:
   - Added `platformEvents: SemanticEventSource` to GameEngine
   - Updated `WorldModel` constructor to accept platform events
   - Parser can emit platform events via `setPlatformEventEmitter()`
   - Text services can access platform events via `getPlatformEvents()`

3. **Event Types**:
   - Parser: `platform.parser.parse_start`, `platform.parser.tokenize_complete`, etc.
   - World: `platform.world.entity_moved`, `platform.world.move_entity_failed`
   - All platform events tagged with `['platform', 'subsystem', 'debug']`

### 4. Key Fixes Applied

#### Player Location Issue
- Problem: Player was stuck "inside themselves"
- Solution: Properly handle pre-existing player entity in story initialization
- Store room IDs since entities can't be looked up by name before creation

#### Build Errors
- Fixed 31 stdlib test failures from API changes
- Updated to current WorldModel APIs
- Created unified text-services package

#### Dynamic Loading
- Parser and language packages are dynamically loaded based on story language
- Created custom module resolver in run-cli.js

## Current Status

### Working:
- ✅ All stdlib tests passing (2,711 tests)
- ✅ Story initialization with rooms and entities
- ✅ Custom vocabulary registration system
- ✅ Platform event system for debugging
- ✅ Player location and movement
- ✅ Basic command parsing

### Pending Issues:
- ❌ "hang cloak on hook" command not reaching HANG action
  - Parser recognizes the verb but command resolution fails
  - Appears to be noun phrase parsing issue ("cloak on hook" treated as single entity)
  - Platform events will help debug this

## Architecture Insights

### Event-Sourced Design
- Events are records of what happened, not triggers
- Event processors apply events to world state
- Platform events separate from game events for debugging

### Vocabulary Flow
1. Language Provider → defines available vocabulary
2. Parser → registers vocabulary with VocabularyRegistry
3. Story → can register additional vocabulary dynamically
4. VocabularyRegistry → manages priorities and lookups

### Parser Architecture
- Tokenization → vocabulary lookup → pattern matching → command structure
- Rich information preservation (articles, modifiers, etc.)
- Platform events at each stage for debugging

## Next Steps
1. Complete platform event implementation in parser
2. Debug why "hang cloak on hook" fails at command resolution
3. Implement CLIEventsTextService to display platform events
4. Test complete Cloak of Darkness gameplay

## Lessons Learned
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Platform events vs game events was crucial
2. **Extensibility**: Parser extension API allows stories to define custom vocabulary
3. **Debugging**: Rich platform events are essential for debugging parser issues
4. **Testing**: Running actual stories reveals integration issues not caught by unit tests
