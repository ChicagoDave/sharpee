# Sharpee Development Progress - Session Update

## Completed in This Session

### Priority 1: Message System ✅
- Created strongly typed message key system
- Built message resolver with multi-language support
- Added parameter interpolation
- Created English message bundle
- Extended events to carry message keys
- Updated example action (taking) to use messages

### Priority 2: Parser Components ✅
- Created vocabulary types and registry
- Built world-agnostic parser
- Implemented command resolver
- Added standard English vocabulary
- Created full parsing pipeline

## Current Architecture State

```
User Input
    ↓
[Parser] → CandidateCommand
    ↓
[Resolver] → ParsedCommand (with entities)
    ↓
[Actions] → Events (with message keys)
    ↓
[Event Processor] → World State Changes
    ↓
[Text Generator] → Output (using message keys)
```

## What's Working Now

1. **Message System**
   - All text uses typed message keys
   - Multi-language ready
   - Integrated with events

2. **Parser System**
   - Tokenizes and parses user input
   - Matches grammar patterns
   - Resolves entities from vocabulary
   - Handles ambiguities

3. **Vocabulary System**
   - Extensible at all levels
   - Dynamic entity vocabulary
   - Standard IF vocabulary included

## Next Implementation Tasks

### Priority 3: Text Generation
1. Create text generator that reads events
2. Use message resolver to generate output
3. Handle event ordering and grouping
4. Connect to game output

### Priority 4: Complete Basic IF
1. Create command executor to orchestrate flow
2. Implement remaining standard actions
3. Build game loop
4. Create working example game
5. Test full flow

### Priority 5: Advanced Features
1. Compound commands ("take all", "drop all except sword")
2. Pronoun resolution ("examine it")
3. Save/load system
4. Story format definition

## Key Files Created

### Message System
- `/packages/stdlib/src/messages/message-keys.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/messages/message-resolver.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/messages/bundles/en-us.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/events/event-extensions.ts`

### Parser System
- `/packages/stdlib/src/parser/vocabulary-types.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/parser/vocabulary-registry.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/parser/parser-types.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/parser/basic-parser.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/parser/command-resolver.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/vocabulary/standard-english.ts`

## Design Principles Maintained

✅ No raw text - everything uses message keys
✅ Parser is world-agnostic
✅ Event-driven architecture
✅ Extensible at all levels
✅ Clear separation of concerns
✅ TypeScript throughout

## Ready for Next Session

The foundation is solid. Next session we can:
1. Build the text generator
2. Create the game loop
3. Wire everything together
4. Run our first complete IF game in Sharpee!

All core principles have been maintained and the architecture is clean and extensible.
