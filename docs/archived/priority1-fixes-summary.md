# Priority 1 Infrastructure Fixes - Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Fixes

### 1. Fixed getContainingRoom() Issue
- **Problem**: Tests were failing because location context showed actor ID instead of room ID
- **Root Cause**: Not a bug in getContainingRoom - it was working correctly
- **Actual Issue**: Test expectations were using hardcoded IDs like 'room1' instead of actual generated IDs like 'r01'
- **Solution**: Updated test expectations to use actual entity IDs

### 2. Fixed Command Creation Helper
- **Problem**: createCommand was creating invalid commands when directObject was undefined
- **Solution**: Added proper checks for entity existence before creating command structure
- **Changes**:
  - Check `directObject?.entity` instead of just `directObject`
  - Check `indirectObject?.entity` instead of just `indirectObject`
  - Validate both entity and parsed structure exist before creating validated references

### 3. Fixed Shared Data Handling for Platform Tests
- **Problem**: Platform tests were using non-existent `world.setSharedData()` method
- **Solution**: Created helper functions that use WorldModel's capability system
- **Files Created**:
  - `platform-test-helpers.ts` with `setupSharedData()` and `getSharedData()` functions
- **Files Updated**:
  - `platform-actions.test.ts` - replaced all setSharedData calls with setupSharedData
  - `quitting.ts` - updated to use `world.getCapability('sharedData')`
  - `saving.ts` - updated to use `world.getCapability('sharedData')`
  - `restoring.ts` - updated to use `world.getCapability('sharedData')`
  - `restarting.ts` - updated to use `world.getCapability('sharedData')`

### 4. Enhanced Debug Logging
- **Added**: Debug logging in setupBasicWorld to catch location issues early
- **Added**: Fallback handling when getContainingRoom returns undefined
- **Purpose**: Makes test failures more informative and easier to debug

## üîÑ Next Steps

### Remaining Test Fixes Needed
1. Update test expectations to use actual entity IDs instead of hardcoded values
2. Fix event data expectations that don't match actual implementation
3. Address message ID mismatches in action tests

### Test Categories Still Failing
- **answering-golden.test.ts**: Message ID and event data mismatches
- **asking-golden.test.ts**: Entity ID references and topic parsing
- **dropping-golden.test.ts**: Missing container/supporter flags in events
- **quitting.test.ts**: Platform event data structure issues
- **searching-golden.test.ts**: Concealment detection logic
- **registry-golden.test.ts**: Pattern matching with language provider
- **inventory-golden.test.ts**: Event data structure for inventory items
- **looking-golden.test.ts**: Dark room handling and contents listing

## üìã Infrastructure Status

‚úÖ **Core Infrastructure Fixed**:
- World model entity creation and ID generation
- Spatial index and containment relationships
- Command creation and validation
- Shared data access through capability system

‚ùå **Still Need Implementation**:
- Pattern matching in action registry (language provider integration)
- Some event data fields not being populated correctly
- Test-specific entity reference fixes

The core infrastructure is now working correctly. The remaining failures are mostly due to:
1. Test expectations not matching actual implementation
2. Missing event data fields in action implementations
3. Language provider integration for pattern matching

These are implementation issues rather than infrastructure problems.
