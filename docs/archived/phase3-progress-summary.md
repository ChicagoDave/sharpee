# Phase 3 Progress Summary - Event Structure Standardization

## Overall Progress
- **Starting point**: 118 failed tests (after Phase 2)
- **Current status**: 105 failed tests
- **Tests fixed**: 13 (11% improvement)

## Actions Fixed

### 1. Inventory Action ✅
- **Issue**: Event data was double-wrapped due to enhanced context wrapping domain events
- **Solution**: Modified enhanced-context.ts to pass domain events (starting with `if.`) directly without wrapping
- **Result**: 17/18 tests passing (only weight calculation still failing)

### 2. Opening Action ✅
- **Issue**: Test expected `item` field but action provided `targetName`
- **Solution**: Added `item` field to event data for backward compatibility
- **Result**: 11/15 tests passing (improved from 8/15)
- **Remaining issues**: Message ID and parameter structure mismatches

## Key Insights

### Event Structure Pattern
1. **Domain events** (`if.*`) should pass data directly to avoid double-wrapping
2. **Action events** (`action.success`, `action.error`) need special handling
3. **Test compatibility** - Sometimes need to add fields for backward compatibility

### Common Issues Found
1. **Event data nesting** - The core createEvent adds both `payload` and `data` for legacy support
2. **Field name mismatches** - Tests expect certain field names that don't match the interfaces
3. **Message ID expectations** - Tests expect specific message IDs that actions aren't using
4. **Parameter structure** - Success/error events need proper params structure

## Next Actions to Fix

Based on the test log, high-impact actions to fix next:
1. **Giving action** - 4 failures, includes reachability issues
2. **Looking action** - 4 failures, message ID mismatches
3. **Searching action** - 3 failures, concealed item handling
4. **Talking action** - 2 failures, conversation topic detection

## Lessons Learned
1. The examining action serves as a good reference for correct implementation
2. Event structure issues are often about data nesting, not missing data
3. Test expectations sometimes require backward compatibility fields
4. The enhanced context fix for domain events was a major breakthrough
