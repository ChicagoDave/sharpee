# Build and Test Status Report

## Build Fix

**Issue**: TypeScript compilation error in `vocabulary-types.ts`
```
error TS1355: A 'const' assertions can only be applied to references to enum members, or string, number, boolean, array, or object literals.
```

**Fix**: Removed the `as const` assertion from the `GrammarPatterns` export since we're already using `Object.freeze()` for immutability.

## Test Fixes Applied

1. **GrammarPatterns Immutability** ✅
   - Used `Object.freeze()` on the main object and all nested arrays
   - Removed conflicting `as const` assertion

2. **ActionRegistry Compatibility** ✅
   - Added `find(idOrPattern)` method that searches by ID first, then by pattern
   - Added support for `aliases` property on actions for backward compatibility

3. **CommandValidator Entity Resolution** ✅ 
   - Modified `getEntitiesInScope()` to use world's `getInScope()` when available
   - Added fallback logic that excludes player and rooms from entity resolution

## Current State

### Build
- The TypeScript compilation error should be fixed
- Run `pnpm build` in the stdlib package to verify

### Tests
- Many tests should now pass with the fixes applied
- Some tests still use deprecated interfaces and need to be removed or updated

### Next Steps

1. Verify the build works: `pnpm build`
2. Run tests to see current status: `pnpm test`
3. Remove or update tests that use deprecated interfaces
4. Address any remaining test failures

## Commands

```bash
# Build the package
cd /mnt/c/repotemp/sharpee/packages/stdlib
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Run specific test suites
pnpm test -- --testNamePattern="GrammarPatterns"
pnpm test -- --testPathPattern="registry"
pnpm test -- --testPathPattern="command-validator-golden"
```
