# Session Summary - August 24, 2025, 04:31

## Session Overview
Fixed CI build errors in the atomic events refactor branch by correcting import paths and updating legacy payload references to use the new data field.

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### Issue 1: EntitySnapshot Import Errors
**Problem**: Three event data files were importing `EntitySnapshot` from `@sharpee/core` where it wasn't exported
- `packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/closing/closing-event-data.ts`
- `packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/dropping/dropping-events.ts`
- `packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/opening/opening-events.ts`

**Root Cause**: `EntitySnapshot` is defined in `packages/stdlib/src/actions/base/snapshot-utils.ts` but the event data files were incorrectly trying to import it from `@sharpee/core`

**Solution**: Updated imports to use the local snapshot-utils module:
```typescript
// Before
import { EntityId, EntitySnapshot } from '@sharpee/core';

// After
import { EntityId } from '@sharpee/core';
import { EntitySnapshot } from '../../base/snapshot-utils';
```

### Issue 2: Legacy Payload References in CLI Platform
**Problem**: `packages/platforms/cli-en-us/src/cli-platform.ts` had multiple references to `payload` field instead of the new `data` field

**Locations Fixed**:
1. Line 84: Removed duplicate `payload: event.data` (already had `data: event.data`)
2. Lines 204, 213, 221, 247: Changed `platformOp.payload.context` to `platformOp.data.context`

**Type Casting**: Had to cast `platformOp.data as any` because `IPlatformEvent` extends `ISemanticEvent` which has `data: unknown`

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/closing/closing-event-data.ts`
- `packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/dropping/dropping-events.ts`
- `packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/opening/opening-events.ts`
- `packages/platforms/cli-en-us/src/cli-platform.ts`

### Build Verification
- ✅ `@sharpee/stdlib` builds successfully
- ✅ `@sharpee/platform-cli-en-us` builds successfully

## Commits Created
1. **45110a1**: `fix: Correct EntitySnapshot imports in event data files`
   - Fixed TypeScript build errors in stdlib package

2. **23d5624**: `fix: Update payload to data references in CLI platform`
   - Fixed both EntitySnapshot imports and payload references
   - Included documentation and cache files

## Key Insights

### Why the Build Passed Locally but Failed in CI
The refactor was completed with all tests passing locally, but CI revealed import issues because:
- Event data files were created during Phase 3.1 (commit f281e94) with incorrect imports
- Local builds may have had TypeScript incremental compilation that masked the errors
- CI performs clean builds that caught the import resolution failures

### Architecture Consideration
`EntitySnapshot` is an IF-domain specific type (with properties like `isOpenable`, `isWearable`, etc.) and ideally should be in `@sharpee/if-domain` rather than `@sharpee/core`. However, since it's currently used extensively in stdlib's snapshot-utils, the immediate fix was to correct the import paths rather than refactor the architecture.

## Status
- Branch: `refactor/atomic-events` 
- All CI build errors resolved
- Ready for PR update and merge
