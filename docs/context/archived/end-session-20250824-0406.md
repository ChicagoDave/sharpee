# Session Summary - August 24, 2025, 04:06

## Session Overview
Completed the **Atomic Events Refactor** - Phases 6, 7, and 8, achieving 100% completion of the entire refactor initiative.

## Major Accomplishments

### Phase 6: Engine Updates ✅
**Event Processing Pipeline**
- Implemented three-stage pipeline in `event-adapter.ts`:
  - **Migration**: Converts legacy events (payload → data)
  - **Normalization**: Ensures consistent event structure
  - **Enrichment**: Adds context (turn, player, location)
- Integrated pipeline into `game-engine.ts` for all event processing

**Function Serialization**
- Added `serializeEventData()` to handle functions in events
- Functions marked as `{__type: 'function', __marker: '[Function]'}`
- `deserializeEventData()` restores placeholder functions
- Enables save/load with events containing provider functions

### Phase 7: Testing & Documentation ✅
**Documentation**
- Created comprehensive **ADR-058**: Atomic Events Implementation
- Included complete migration guide for action and story authors
- Documented three-phase pattern with code examples
- Added performance considerations and future optimizations

**Testing**
- Created `historical-accuracy.test.ts` to verify event completeness
- Added `event-size-analysis.test.ts` for performance measurement
- Text service tests: 18 passing with provider function support
- Platform operations: 19 tests passing (save/load verified)

**Performance Results**
- Average event size: **~306 bytes**
- Room descriptions: **~558 bytes**
- 500-turn game estimate: **~276KB**
- Memory usage: Excellent, well within limits

### Phase 8: Cleanup & Validation ✅
- Verified minimal world queries remain (only debug helper)
- Kept legacy migration for backward compatibility
- Reviewed TODOs (remaining are for future features)
- Confirmed all tests pass
- Validated Cloak of Darkness builds and runs
- Updated `package.json` to use vitest instead of jest

## Code Changes

### Files Modified
- `packages/engine/src/event-adapter.ts` - Added complete pipeline
- `packages/engine/src/game-engine.ts` - Integrated pipeline, function serialization
- `stories/cloak-of-darkness/package.json` - Updated to vitest

### Files Created
- `docs/architecture/ADR-058-atomic-events.md` - Architecture documentation
- `packages/engine/tests/historical-accuracy.test.ts` - Event completeness tests
- `packages/engine/tests/performance/event-size-analysis.test.ts` - Performance analysis

## Technical Decisions

### Event Pipeline Design
- Three-stage pipeline ensures consistency across all events
- Legacy migration maintains backward compatibility
- Enrichment adds context without requiring world queries

### Serialization Strategy
- Functions marked with special type indicator
- Placeholder functions restored on deserialization
- Maintains event structure while handling non-serializable data

### Performance Trade-offs
- Accepted larger event sizes for complete snapshots
- ~306 bytes average is reasonable for the benefits gained
- 276KB for 500 turns is excellent memory efficiency

## Key Metrics
- **Lines changed**: 1000+ across 7 files
- **Tests added**: 12 new tests across 2 test files
- **Documentation**: 225 lines of ADR-058
- **Performance**: Sub-10KB event size limit maintained

## Completion Status

### All 8 Phases Complete ✅
1. ✅ Core interfaces updated
2. ✅ Action architecture redesigned
3. ✅ 10 actions migrated to three-phase pattern
4. ✅ Text service refactored (no world dependencies)
5. ✅ Cloak of Darkness updated
6. ✅ Engine pipeline implemented
7. ✅ Testing & documentation complete
8. ✅ Cleanup & validation done

### Completion Criteria Met ✅
- Actions follow three-phase pattern
- Text service has no world model dependencies
- Events are self-contained with all needed data
- Historical replay shows accurate past state
- All tests pass
- Documentation complete with migration guide

## Impact

### Immediate Benefits
- **Loose Coupling**: Text service independent of world model
- **Historical Accuracy**: Complete snapshots enable accurate replay
- **Testability**: Self-contained events are easier to test
- **Debugging**: Complete event data improves debugging

### Long-term Benefits
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new event types
- **Performance**: Predictable memory usage
- **Save/Load**: Robust serialization handling

## Next Steps (Future Work)
1. Consider event compression for large saves
2. Implement selective snapshots for optimization
3. Add event versioning for long-term compatibility
4. Monitor production performance metrics

## Session Commit
```
feat: Complete Phases 6-8 of atomic events refactor

- Commit hash: b63f658
```

## Summary
This session successfully completed the entire Atomic Events refactor, transforming the Sharpee IF engine to use self-contained events with complete entity snapshots. The architecture now enables accurate historical replay without world model dependencies, while maintaining excellent performance (~276KB for 500 turns) and full backward compatibility. The implementation is production-ready with comprehensive documentation and testing.
