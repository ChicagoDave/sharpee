# Session Summary - 2025-08-11 19:32

## Overview
Successfully fixed all TypeScript compilation errors in the stdlib package, reducing from 118 errors to 0.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed ValidationResult Interface Issues
- Removed state sharing between `validate()` and `execute()` methods
- Actions now rebuild all necessary data from context in `execute()`
- Fixed error format from objects to strings throughout all actions

### 2. Major Files Fixed

#### State Reference Fixes (removed `state.` references in execute methods):
- help.ts - Rebuilt eventData from context
- inventory.ts - Duplicated complex weight/burden calculations
- pushing.ts - Rebuilt push type handling
- quitting.ts, scoring.ts, saving.ts, restoring.ts, restarting.ts
- pulling.ts - Complete rebuild of complex switch logic (levers, cords, attached items)
- showing.ts, sleeping.ts, smelling.ts - Rebuilt all event data
- inserting.ts - Fixed delegation to putting action
- listening.ts - Rebuilt sound detection logic
- attacking.ts - Rebuilt verb detection and break logic
- climbing.ts - Rebuilt directional vs object climbing

#### Error Format Fixes (changed from `error: { messageId: string }` to `error: string`):
- giving.ts, closing.ts, going.ts
- pulling.ts (8 instances)
- showing.ts (5 instances)
- sleeping.ts, smelling.ts

#### Other Fixes:
- again.ts - Fixed CommandHistoryEntry property names (actionId not action, originalText not command)
- trace.ts - Changed validate to return ValidationResult instead of boolean
- context.ts - Added missing validate property to mock action
- pushing.ts - Fixed duplicate default clause in switch statement
- restarting.ts - Fixed possibly undefined error with optional chaining
- restoring.ts/saving.ts - Removed invalid `parsed.noun` reference
- attacking.ts - Changed from parsing rawInput to using `parsed.action` from parser

## Architectural Decisions

### No State Sharing Pattern
- ValidationResult no longer carries state between validate() and execute()
- Each method is now independent and stateless
- Execute methods rebuild all necessary data from ActionContext
- This ensures cleaner separation of concerns and easier testing

### Parser Integration
- Actions should never parse rawInput directly
- All verb/action information comes from the parser's structured output
- Raw text is only used when specifically needed (e.g., writing on objects)

## Technical Debt Addressed
- Completed Phase 2 of the refactoring plan
- All actions now follow the correct validate/execute pattern
- Removed legacy state-sharing approach
- Standardized error handling across all actions

## Build Status
- **Before**: 118 TypeScript errors
- **After**: 0 TypeScript errors
- Build successfully passes: `pnpm build`

## Files Modified
- 45+ action files in `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/`
- All actions now comply with the enhanced-types interfaces
- No state sharing between validate and execute methods

## Next Steps
- Implement ActionBehavior pattern for complex actions (ADR-051 already written)
- Consider further optimization of duplicated logic between validate/execute
- Update tests to match new patterns if needed

## Key Learnings
1. Don't use rawInput for parsing - that's the parser's job
2. Rebuilding data in execute() is acceptable for maintaining statelessness
3. Simple string errors are cleaner than error objects for ValidationResult
4. The parser provides structured data - use it instead of text parsing

## Session Duration
Approximately 2.5 hours of focused refactoring and debugging.
