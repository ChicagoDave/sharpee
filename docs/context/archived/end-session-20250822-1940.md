# Session Summary - August 22, 2025 19:40

## Session Overview
Reassessed ADR-057 (Rules System) based on clearer requirements, explored Sharpee's actual architectural needs vs Inform 7's patterns, and decided to postpone the rules implementation to focus on the atomic events refactor.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Simplified ADR-057 (Rulebook System)
- **Rewrote completely** from complex class hierarchies to simple rulebook containers
- **Key simplifications**:
  - Rules are just objects with `id`, `order`, `when`, and `run`
  - Rulebooks organize rules by name (before, after, everyTurn)
  - No entity attachment - rules are standalone
  - CommandExecutor gets rulebook injected and executes at known points

**Final structure**:
```typescript
interface Rule {
  id: string;
  order?: number;
  when: (context) => boolean;
  run: (context) => RuleResult | void;
}
```

### 2. Analyzed Sharpee's Architectural Needs
Created two assessments examining what Sharpee actually needs vs copying Inform:

#### Sharpee's Ways of Working:
- **Event-driven architecture** - Everything flows through semantic events
- **Explicit pipeline** - Parse → Validate → Execute → Report
- **Clean separation** - Engine, stdlib, world model, text service are distinct
- **Immutable transitions** - Events describe what happened

#### What Sharpee Needs:
- **Action control rulebooks** (before, instead, after) - Not check/carry_out
- **Turn sequence rulebooks** (whenPlayBegins, everyTurn, whenPlayEnds)
- **Maybe accessibility rulebooks** (deciding_scope, visibility, reachability)

#### What Sharpee Doesn't Need:
- Parser rulebooks (handled by separate parser)
- Text generation rulebooks (handled by text service)
- Complex activity system (overkill)

### 3. Designed Generic Rulebook Implementation
Based on your guidance for flexible, non-hardcoded rulebooks:

```typescript
// Engine manages:
const rulebooks = new List<IRulebook>();

// Authors can:
context.addRulebook(new Rulebook('my-rules'));
context.addRule(rulebook, new Rule({...}));

// Standard rules loaded from:
stdlib/src/rules/
  before.ts
  after.ts
  every-turn.ts
```

### 4. Decision to Postpone Rules
After assessing current state:
- **Phase 1 Complete**: Core interfaces updated for atomic events
- **Phase 2 Needed**: Add `report()` function to Action interface
- **Phase 3 Postponed**: Rules system needs more design discussion
- **Continue with**: Three-phase action pattern (validate/execute/report)

Updated the atomic events plan to reflect this decision.

## Technical Insights

### Why Postpone Rules?
1. **Big change** - Rules touch many parts of the system
2. **Design questions** - Need feedback on rulebook approach
3. **Not blocking** - Atomic events can proceed without rules
4. **Clean separation** - Three-phase actions work independently

### Current Implementation Status
```typescript
// What we have:
interface Action {
  validate(context: ActionContext): ValidationResult;
  execute(context: ActionContext): ISemanticEvent[];
}

// What we need:
interface Action {
  validate(context: ActionContext): ValidationResult;
  execute(context: ActionContext): void;  // Mutations only
  report(context: ActionContext): ISemanticEvent[];  // Events only
}
```

## Files Modified

### Created
- `/docs/assessment/rulebook-architecture.md` - Analysis of Inform's rulebook system
- `/docs/assessment/sharpee-rulebook-needs.md` - What Sharpee actually needs
- `/docs/assessment/rulebook-implementation.md` - Generic rulebook design
- `/docs/context/end-session-20250822-1940.md` - This session summary

### Modified
- `/docs/architecture/adrs/adr-057-before-after-rules.md`
  - Completely rewritten for simpler rulebook approach
  - Status changed to "On Hold"

- `/docs/work/atomic-events-refactor-plan.md`
  - Removed rules references from Phase 2
  - Marked Phase 3 (Rules) as postponed
  - Renumbered action migration to new Phase 3

## No Commits Made
All changes remain uncommitted on the `refactor/atomic-events` branch.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 2):
1. **Add `report()` to Action interface** in `packages/stdlib/src/actions/enhanced-types.ts`
2. **Update CommandExecutor** to call validate → execute → report
3. **Create helper utilities** for capturing entity/room snapshots
4. **Add migration shim** for backward compatibility

### Then (Phase 3):
1. **Migrate looking.ts** first (most complex, sets pattern)
2. **Migrate examining.ts** next (similar pattern)
3. **Continue with other actions** in priority order

### Future (When Ready):
1. **Revisit rules design** with team feedback
2. **Implement generic rulebook system** if approved
3. **Migrate special cases to rules**

## Open Questions

1. **Migration strategy**: Should we update all actions at once or gradually?
2. **Backward compatibility**: How long to maintain shim for old actions?
3. **Event data structure**: Standardize snapshot formats?
4. **Rules timing**: When to revisit the rules implementation?

## Session Impact
Successfully refocused on the core atomic events work by postponing the rules complexity. The three-phase action pattern (validate/execute/report) provides the foundation needed for atomic events without requiring the full rules engine. This keeps the refactor scope manageable while still achieving the main goals of historical accuracy and type safety.

## Plans Updated
Both work plans have been updated to remove rules implementation:
- **atomic-events-refactor-plan.md**: Removed Phase 3 (Rules), renumbered subsequent phases, removed rule references
- **atomic-events-checklist.md**: Marked rules as postponed, removed rule-related tasks, renumbered phases
- Timeline reduced from 19-27 hours to 18-23 hours
