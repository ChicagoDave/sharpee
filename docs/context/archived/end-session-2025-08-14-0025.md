# Session Summary: 2025-08-14

## Objective
Get Cloak of Darkness story running with the new ADR-052 event handler pattern after refactoring.

## Key Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Module Resolution
- **Problem**: Node.js couldn't find `@sharpee/*` packages when running stories
- **Solution**: Used existing `run-platform.js` with module resolution helpers

### 2. Entity Resolution Bug
- **Problem**: "hang cloak on hook" failed with "You can't see any hook here"
- **Root Cause**: Multiple issues in entity resolution:
  - Parser didn't recognize "cloak" and "hook" as nouns
  - `findWhere` returned array instead of single entity
  - Scenery items were being filtered out inappropriately
  
### 3. Architecture Discovery: Scenery Filtering
- **Problem**: `WorldModel.findWhere()` was filtering out scenery and invisible items by default
- **Insight**: This violated separation of concerns - entity resolution should be separate from interaction validation
- **Solution**: Removed filtering from `findWhere`, making it a pure query function
- **Principle**: Actions should validate their own requirements (e.g., TAKE checks for scenery trait)

## Code Changes

### WorldModel (`packages/world-model/src/world/WorldModel.ts`)
```typescript
// Before:
findWhere(predicate: (entity: IFEntity) => boolean, options?: FindOptions): IFEntity[] {
  // ... filtered by scenery, visibility, etc.
}

// After:
findWhere(predicate: (entity: IFEntity) => boolean): IFEntity[] {
  return Array.from(this.entities.values()).filter(predicate);
}
```

### Command Validator (`packages/stdlib/src/validation/command-validator.ts`)
- Added `[0]` to get first element from `findWhere` array return
- Fixed entity resolution to include scenery for indirect objects

### Test Updates
- Updated tests to expect scenery items in query results
- Tests now validate that actions (not queries) handle scenery filtering

## Architectural Lessons Learned

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Entity Resolution**: Finding things by name/synonym
- **Scope System**: Determining what's perceivable
- **Action Validation**: Deciding what's valid for a verb
- Each layer should do one thing well

### 2. Late Binding Principle
- Don't filter early based on usage assumptions
- Let actions decide what's valid for their semantics
- Similar to compiler design: parse liberally, validate strictly

### 3. IF Domain Conventions
- Scenery means "fixed in place", not "non-interactable"
- An entity can have multiple traits (hook is both scenery AND supporter)
- Following established IF patterns (TADS/Inform) prevents complexity

## Current Status

### Completed
- âœ… Module resolution fixed
- âœ… Entity resolution includes all entities
- âœ… findWhere returns correct results
- âœ… Tests updated to match new behavior

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Custom action registration (HANG and READ)
- ðŸ”„ Testing Cloak of Darkness gameplay

### Next Steps
1. Verify custom HANG action works with proper entity resolution
2. Test READ action for the message
3. Validate event handlers fire correctly (ADR-052)
4. Complete full playthrough of Cloak of Darkness

## Technical Debt Addressed
- Removed premature optimization (scenery filtering)
- Simplified query interface (removed FindOptions)
- Improved architectural clarity
