# Session Summary - 2025-08-25 03:56

## Session Goals
Fix remaining test failures in stdlib package after the three-phase action pattern refactor.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Fixed World-Model Package Tests
- **Issue**: Tests were failing because entity.add() was preventing duplicate traits
- **Solution**: Reverted the duplicate prevention and updated tests to verify warning behavior instead
- **Result**: All world-model tests passing (13 skipped)

### 2. Fixed Parser-en-us Package Tests  
- **Issue**: Tests expected lowercase direction values but got uppercase (e.g., "north" vs "NORTH")
- **Solution**: Updated tests to use Direction constants from world-model
- **Result**: All parser-en-us tests passing

### 3. Fixed Stdlib Package Test Issues

#### Test Infrastructure Fixes:
- **parseCommand and createParserWithWorld exports**: Added missing exports to test-utils/index.ts
- **expectEvent helper**: Updated to use toMatchObject for partial matching to handle entity snapshots
- **Test helper corrections**: Fixed tests calling action.execute() directly instead of using executeAction()

#### Action Fixes Completed:
- **closing action**: 
  - Added `reason` field to error events for test compatibility
  - Fixed missing `targetName` in successful close events
  - All 15 tests passing

- **removing action**:
  - Added `reason` field to error events
  - Fixed edge case tests using wrong helper method
  - 18/20 tests passing (2 remaining edge cases)

#### Remaining Stdlib Failures (from log analysis):
- **38 total failing tests** across 12 test files
- **93 skipped tests**
- Most failures fall into categories:
  1. Missing error codes/reason fields (20 failures) 
  2. Event structure issues (8 failures)
  3. Test utility issues (5 failures)
  4. Assertion type errors (3 failures)
  5. Darkness/light test (1 failure)

## Key Discoveries

### Error Data Creation Code Smell
Identified that error data is being created inline in action report() methods rather than using centralized builders in -data.ts files. This violates separation of concerns:
- Success event data: Built by builders in -data.ts files âœ“
- Error event data: Built inline in report() methods âœ—

This should be refactored to have error data builders in -data.ts files for consistency.

### Event Message Flow
Confirmed the error message flow:
1. Action sets `messageId` and `reason` (for backward compatibility) 
2. Text service looks for messageId/error/reason (in that order)
3. Text service tries `${actionId}.${messageId}` then just `messageId`
4. Language provider (lang-en-us) provides the actual localized text

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Continue Test Fixes):
1. Fix remaining actions' error reporting (taking, dropping, going, inserting, putting, opening, unlocking)
2. Fix test utility null checks
3. Fix assertion type errors  
4. Investigate darkness test failure
5. Enable or remove skipped tests

### Future Refactoring:
1. Create ADR documenting the error data creation code smell
2. Refactor all actions to use error data builders in -data.ts files
3. Consider consolidating error handling patterns across all actions

## Status
- World-model package: âœ… All tests passing
- Parser-en-us package: âœ… All tests passing  
- Stdlib package: ðŸ”§ 38 failures remaining (down from initial count)

The three-phase pattern refactor is mostly working, but needs completion of error handling standardization and test fixes.
