# Work Session Summary - August 25, 2024, 22:07

## Session Overview
Created comprehensive design documentation for Sharpee interactive fiction engine actions by analyzing existing implementation code and documenting the current design patterns, logic flows, and data structures.

## Actions Documented (8 of 35 total)

### Completed Design Documents
1. **dropping-design.md** - Complete documentation of the dropping action including three-phase pattern, delegation to behaviors, and snapshot system
2. **eating-design.md** - Documented food consumption action with implicit taking, multi-portion support, and taste/quality variations
3. **entering-design.md** - Detailed entry mechanics for containers/supporters with occupancy management and posture support
4. **exiting-design.md** - Inverse of entering with automatic destination determination and preposition mapping
5. **giving-design.md** - Social action for item transfer with recipient preferences and capacity management
6. **help-design.md** - Meta-action for help system with topic detection and event-driven content delivery
7. **inventory-design.md** - Observable inventory checking with weight burden calculation and multi-event output
8. **listening-design.md** - Sensory action for sound detection with environmental scanning and sound categorization

## Key Findings and Patterns

### Common Implementation Issues Identified
1. **Code Duplication** - Most actions duplicate entire validation logic in execute phase
2. **No Three-Phase Separation** - Many actions combine validation, execution, and reporting
3. **Unused Validation Results** - Validate phase results often discarded and recalculated

### Consistent Design Patterns
1. **Event-Driven Architecture** - Actions emit domain events for state changes
2. **Trait-Based Behaviors** - Heavy use of trait system for entity capabilities
3. **Behavior Delegation** - Complex logic delegated to behavior classes
4. **Observable Actions** - Some actions (inventory, listening) are observable by NPCs

### Documentation Structure
Each design document includes:
- Action overview and purpose
- Required messages list
- Detailed validation logic
- Execution flow
- Data structures
- Traits and behaviors used
- Message selection logic
- Integration points
- Error handling
- Current limitations
- Recommended improvements

## Remaining Work
27 actions still need design documentation:
- locking, looking, opening, pulling, pushing, putting
- quitting, reading, removing, restarting, restoring, saving
- scoring, searching, showing, sleeping, smelling
- switching_off, switching_on, taking_off, talking, throwing
- touching, turning, unlocking, waiting, wearing

## Technical Observations
1. **Performance Concerns** - Duplicate logic execution impacts performance
2. **Maintenance Burden** - Code duplication makes updates error-prone
3. **Inconsistent Patterns** - Some actions follow ADR-051 (three-phase), others don't
4. **Rich Feature Set** - Sophisticated systems for weight, preferences, occupancy, etc.

## Recommendations for Future Sessions
1. Continue documenting remaining 27 actions
2. Consider creating a summary document comparing action implementations
3. Identify candidates for refactoring based on duplication patterns
4. Document common behavior classes referenced across actions

## Files Created
- `/docs/packages/stdlib/requirements/dropping-design.md`
- `/docs/packages/stdlib/requirements/eating-design.md`
- `/docs/packages/stdlib/requirements/entering-design.md`
- `/docs/packages/stdlib/requirements/exiting-design.md`
- `/docs/packages/stdlib/requirements/giving-design.md`
- `/docs/packages/stdlib/requirements/help-design.md`
- `/docs/packages/stdlib/requirements/inventory-design.md`
- `/docs/packages/stdlib/requirements/listening-design.md`

## Notes
- Documentation captures current implementation as-is without proposing changes
- Each document serves as a reference for understanding action behavior
- Identified patterns will be useful for future refactoring efforts
- The systematic approach ensures consistent documentation quality
