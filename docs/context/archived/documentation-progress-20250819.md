# Documentation Progress - August 19, 2025

## Session Overview
While waiting for the full build to complete, we've made significant progress on platform documentation for both authors and platform engineers.

## Documentation Created

### 1. Documentation Plan (`docs/documentation-plan.md`)
- Comprehensive documentation strategy
- Structure for both author and developer docs
- Implementation priorities and success metrics
- Tools and infrastructure planning

### 2. Author Documentation (`docs/getting-started/authors/README.md`)
- Complete getting started guide for story writers
- Basic concepts: rooms, objects, actions
- Trait system explanation
- Event handlers and customization
- Common patterns and examples
- Testing and debugging guidance

### 3. Extension Development Guide (`docs/getting-started/developers/extension-development-guide.md`)
- Comprehensive guide for creating extensions
- Architecture and lifecycle explanation
- Step-by-step tutorial with code examples
- Custom actions, traits, and events
- Grammar extensions and capabilities
- Testing strategies
- Publishing process and best practices

### 4. Contribution Guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- Complete guide for platform contributors
- Development setup instructions
- Architecture overview
- Pull request process
- Coding standards (TypeScript, events, testing)
- Package-specific guidelines
- Release process documentation

## Key Documentation Features

### For Authors
- **Beginner-friendly**: Starts with minimal concepts
- **Progressive learning**: From basic to advanced features
- **Practical examples**: Real code that can be copied
- **Common patterns**: Locked doors, hidden objects, scoring
- **Testing guidance**: Debug commands and strategies

### For Platform Engineers
- **Architecture clarity**: Event-driven patterns explained
- **Extension system**: Complete guide with examples
- **Type safety**: Interface conventions and patterns
- **Testing requirements**: Coverage and structure
- **Best practices**: Namespacing, validation, error handling

```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (When build completes)
1. Return to blood-magic extension development
2. Complete extension registration mechanism
3. Implement remaining features

### Documentation TODO
1. Generate API reference documentation
2. Create example stories with annotations
3. Create example extensions
4. Set up documentation site (Docusaurus)
5. Create video tutorials (optional)

## Benefits of Documentation Work

1. **Onboarding**: New contributors can get started quickly
2. **Clarity**: Clear patterns and best practices established
3. **Consistency**: Standards for code and contributions
4. **Community**: Foundation for community growth
5. **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain with clear guidelines

## Summary

While waiting for the build, we've created foundational documentation that will:
- Help authors create interactive fiction stories
- Enable developers to create extensions
- Guide contributors to the platform
- Establish standards and best practices
- Provide clear examples and patterns

This documentation work is essential for the platform's growth and adoption, making it accessible to both creative writers and technical contributors.
