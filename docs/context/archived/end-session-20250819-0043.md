- Core architecture is stable
- I-prefix refactoring complete
- 2,700+ tests demonstrate maturity
- Signals readiness for early adoption
- Alpha qualifier manages expectations

### Privacy Implementation
```bash
# Added to .gitignore
packages/extensions/blood-magic/

# Removed from tracking but kept locally
git rm -r --cached packages/extensions/blood-magic
```

### Release Documentation Structure
1. **CHANGELOG.md** - Technical changes
2. **RELEASE_NOTES.md** - GitHub release content
3. **Blog Announcement** - Community-facing story
4. **README Badges** - Visual status indicators

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Version 1.0.0-alpha.1**: Signals architectural maturity while maintaining pre-release status
2. **Blood-Magic Removal**: Keeps story content private while releasing platform
3. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Multiple formats for different audiences
4. **No NPM Publishing Yet**: GitHub release only for alpha phase
