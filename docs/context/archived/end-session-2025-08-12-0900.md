## Session Summary
Continued from previous session working on stdlib test failures. Made progress on understanding and fixing the validation pattern issues that were causing 173 test failures.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Identified Root Cause of Test Failures
- Found that the test helper `executeWithValidation` in taking-golden.test.ts was checking for `validation.isValid` instead of `validation.valid`
- This mismatch was causing all validation tests to fail because the property didn't exist
- The ValidationResult interface correctly defines `valid: boolean`, not `isValid`

### 2. Fixed Test Helper Pattern
- Updated executeWithValidation function to:
  - Check `validation.valid` instead of `validation.isValid`
  - Properly pass error details including messageId, reason, and params
  - Remove the unused `validation.state` parameter from execute() call

### 3. Understood Architectural Constraint
- User reminded that "actions use world-model behavior for validation and execution"
- This means actions MUST delegate to behavior classes like ActorBehavior, ContainerBehavior, etc.
- The taking action is correctly using `ActorBehavior.canTakeItem()` and `ActorBehavior.takeItem()`
- The issue was in the test helper, not the action implementation

## Current State

### Test Status
- Fixed the validation helper in taking-golden.test.ts
- Need to apply same fix to other test files
- 173 tests were failing due to this pattern issue

### Files Modified
- `/packages/stdlib/tests/unit/actions/taking-golden.test.ts` - Fixed executeWithValidation helper

### Todo List Status
1. ‚úÖ Assess stdlib test failures and categorize issues
2. üîÑ Fix validation pattern in taking action test helper (in progress)
3. ‚è≥ Create validation test helper
4. ‚è≥ Fix validation in other manipulation actions
5. ‚è≥ Fix message ID mismatches
6. ‚è≥ Fix AGAIN action command filtering
7. ‚è≥ Remove missing author action references
8. ‚è≥ Run full test suite to verify fixes

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Run taking-golden tests to verify the fix works
2. Apply the same executeWithValidation fix to all other golden test files:
   - opening-golden.test.ts
   - closing-golden.test.ts
   - dropping-golden.test.ts
   - putting-golden.test.ts
   - removing-golden.test.ts
   - inserting-golden.test.ts
   - examining-golden.test.ts
   - going-golden.test.ts
   - entering-golden.test.ts
   - searching-golden.test.ts
   - switching_on-golden.test.ts
   - switching_off-golden.test.ts
   - locking-golden.test.ts
   - unlocking-golden.test.ts
   - touching-golden.test.ts
   - wearing-golden.test.ts
   - taking_off-golden.test.ts

### Pattern to Apply
All test files with executeWithValidation helper need this change:
```typescript
// OLD (incorrect)
if (!validation.isValid) {
  return [context.event('action.error', {
    actionId: context.action.id,
    ...validation.error
  })];
}
return action.execute(context, validation.state);

// NEW (correct)
if (!validation.valid) {
  return [context.event('action.error', {
    actionId: context.action.id,
    messageId: validation.error,
    reason: validation.error,
    params: validation.params
  })];
}
return action.execute(context);
```

## Technical Notes

### Key Insight
The test failures were NOT due to actions doing their own validation instead of using behaviors. The actions are correctly delegating to behaviors. The issue was a simple property name mismatch in the test helper that simulates the CommandExecutor flow.

### Validation Pattern
The correct validation pattern (ADR-041) is:
- Actions have `validate(context): ValidationResult` method
- ValidationResult has `valid: boolean`, not `isValid`
- Actions delegate validation to world-model behaviors
- Test helpers must match this interface exactly

## Risks and Blockers
- None identified - the fix is straightforward and should resolve most test failures
- May still have some message ID mismatches to fix after validation is working
