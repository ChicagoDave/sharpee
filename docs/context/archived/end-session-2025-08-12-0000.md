# Session Summary - 2025-08-12 00:00

## Overview
Major architectural pivot from ActionBehaviors (ADR-051) to Event Handlers (ADR-052) after discovering fundamental design flaw in our event system. Realized that "events without handlers are just logs" - we had no way for authors to implement custom game logic.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Identified Core Design Flaw

#### The Problem
- Our system emits events (`if.event.pushed`, `if.event.taken`) but has no subscription mechanism
- Authors couldn't implement custom logic (e.g., push book â†’ open bookshelf)
- Events were fire-and-forget with no way to handle them

#### The Journey
- Started by refactoring pushing.ts to use ActionBehaviors
- Created 5 pushing behaviors (Button, Heavy, Revealing, Sliding, Default)
- Realized unlimited author-specific cases exist (push table, pull stove, throw crystal)
- Questioned if ActionBehaviors were the right abstraction

### 2. Explored Multiple Design Approaches

#### Options Considered
1. **ActionBehaviors** - Specialized classes for common patterns
   - Problem: Can't handle author-specific cases
   
2. **Custom Handlers in Story Registry**
   - Problem: Indirection, logic separate from entities
   
3. **Custom Handlers in Traits**
   - Problem: Serialization of functions
   
4. **Entity-Based Event Handlers** (Selected)
   - Solution: Entities define handlers for events that affect them

### 3. Designed Event Handler System (ADR-052)

#### Two-Tier Architecture
1. **Entity Handlers** - Direct object reactions
   ```typescript
   redBook.on = {
     pushed: (event) => {
       // Open bookshelf logic
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Story Handlers (Daemons)** - Complex multi-entity logic
   ```typescript
   story.on('if.event.pushed', (event) => {
     // Three statues puzzle logic
   })
   ```

#### Key Insights
- Every pushable/pullable object needs custom logic
- No truly "generic" button pushes in IF
- Events aren't just reports - they're the mechanism for game logic
- Serialization non-issue: handlers rebuild when story loads

### 4. Created Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Remove ActionBehavior System
- Delete all behavior files (~30+ files)
- Revert actions to original state
- Mark ADR-051 as superseded

#### Phase 2: Implement Event Handlers
- Extend IFEntity with `on` property
- Add event system to Story class
- Update actions to emit and check handlers

## Technical Decisions

### Why Event Handlers Over ActionBehaviors

1. **ActionBehaviors assumed generic patterns exist**
   - Reality: Every button/lever does something specific
   - No value in ButtonPushBehavior if every button needs custom logic

2. **Event handlers are intuitive**
   - Logic lives with the entity (or story for complex cases)
   - Direct cause-and-effect relationship

3. **No serialization issues**
   - Handlers are code, rebuilt when story loads
   - Only state is saved/restored

### Event Flow

1. Player action (push book)
2. Action validates and executes
3. Action emits event
4. Entity handler fires (if defined)
5. Story handlers fire (if any)
6. UI/logging handlers fire

### Modified Files (3)

- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/pushing/pushing.ts` - Refactored (to be reverted)
- `/packages/stdlib/src/action-behaviors/pushing/index.ts` - Reduced to single behavior

### Files to be Removed (~30+)
- All ActionBehavior implementation files
- All ActionBehavior test files
- Supporting documentation

## Metrics
- **Lines to be removed**: ~2000+ (ActionBehavior system)
- **Lines to be added**: ~500 (Event handler system)
- **Net simplification**: ~1500 lines
- **Time invested**: ~2 hours
- **Architectural pivot**: Complete redesign of custom logic system

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. Remove all ActionBehavior code
2. Revert modified actions
3. Update ADR-051 to superseded status

### Short Term (Week 2-3)
1. Implement IFEntity.on interface
2. Add Story event system
3. Update actions to use handlers
4. Write comprehensive tests

### Medium Term (Week 4)
1. Test with real stories
2. Write author documentation
3. Create common pattern helpers

## Key Insights

1. **"Events without handlers are just logs"** - The fundamental realization that drove the pivot

2. **No generic patterns in IF** - Every interactive object has specific, story-unique behavior

3. **Composition over abstraction** - Simple event handlers beat complex class hierarchies

4. **Author experience matters** - The system should be intuitive, not clever

5. **Bottom-up design works** - We found the flaw by trying to implement real scenarios

## Philosophical Shift

We moved from trying to abstract and categorize behaviors (ActionBehaviors) to embracing that every interaction in IF is unique and needs custom logic (Event Handlers). This is simpler, more flexible, and more aligned with how IF authors think about their stories.
