# Session Summary - 2025-08-10 13:45

## Session Overview
Continued implementation of meta-commands system for Sharpee IF engine, focusing on making author/debug commands built-in and redesigning the command syntax for better usability.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Completed Meta-Command Infrastructure
- Meta-commands successfully skip turn increment and command history
- System events (parser, validation) emit when debug flags are enabled
- Fixed capability test to expect 6 capabilities (added DEBUG capability)
- Fixed text-services to use `getCapability()` instead of deprecated `getSharedData()`

### 2. Identified Architecture Issues
- **Problem Found**: Author actions were included in standardActions but parser didn't know their vocabulary
- **Root Cause**: Disconnect between action registration and parser vocabulary
- Multiple vocabulary registries exist (stdlib, if-domain, lang-en-us)
- Parser loads vocabulary from language provider but author actions weren't there

### 3. Redesigned Author Commands
- **Old Design**: "parser events on/off" - didn't fit standard IF patterns
- **New Design**: "trace [target] on/off" - clean VERB NOUN PARTICLE pattern
- Replaced three separate actions with single `TraceAction`
- Commands:
  - `trace` - Show current status
  - `trace on/off` - Enable/disable all tracing
  - `trace parser on/off` - Control parser tracing
  - `trace validation on/off` - Control validation tracing
  - `trace system on/off` - Control system tracing
  - `trace all on/off` - Control all tracing

### 4. Implementation Progress
- ✅ Created new `TraceAction` extending `MetaAction`
- ✅ Removed old author actions (ParserEventsAction, ValidationEventsAction, SystemEventsAction)
- ✅ Updated standardActions to include TraceAction
- ✅ Updated vocabulary in both stdlib and lang-en-us
- ✅ Built all packages successfully
- ⏳ Testing in game pending

## Key Technical Insights

### Vocabulary Architecture Discovery
1. Parser automatically loads vocabulary via `initializeVocabulary()`
2. Uses `adaptVerbVocabulary()` to get verbs from language provider
3. Language provider has `getVerbs()` method returning verb definitions
4. This creates automatic vocabulary registration (Option 1 from our analysis)

### Language Layer Responsibility
- Language provider owns the actual words ("trace", "parser", "on", "off")
- Different languages would have different words
- Actions own the behavior (what happens when executed)
- Parser bridges between words and actions

### Pattern Matching Issue
- Original "parser events on" didn't match standard patterns
- Standard IF uses VERB NOUN or VERB patterns
- New "trace parser on" fits VERB NOUN PARTICLE pattern better

## Files Modified

### Removed
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/author/parser-events.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/author/validation-events.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/author/system-events.ts`

### Created
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/author/trace.ts` - New unified trace action

### Modified
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/author/index.ts` - Export only TraceAction
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/index.ts` - Use TraceAction instead of old actions
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/meta-registry.ts` - Updated documentation
- `/packages/stdlib/src/vocabulary/standard-english.ts` - Added trace verb
- `/packages/lang-en-us/src/data/verbs.ts` - Added TRACE constant and verb definition
- `/packages/engine/src/command-executor.ts` - Emits system events based on debug flags
- `/packages/engine/src/game-engine.ts` - Added/removed verb registration attempts
- `/packages/text-services/src/cli-events-text-service.ts` - Fixed to use getCapability()
- `/stories/cloak-of-darkness/run-platform.js` - Updated test commands to use trace syntax

## Architectural Decisions Made

### Chose "trace [target] on/off" Syntax
- Rejected "untrace" as awkward
- Rejected "debug" in favor of more accurate "trace"
- Chose explicit on/off over toggle for clarity
- Follows standard IF command patterns

### Single Action Approach
- One TraceAction handles all trace commands
- Validates different patterns (trace, trace on, trace parser on)
- Cleaner than multiple separate actions

### Vocabulary in Language Provider
- Confirmed that language provider should own the words
- Parser loads vocabulary automatically on construction
- Actions referenced by ID, not by vocabulary

## Outstanding Issues

### Testing Not Complete
- Need to verify trace commands work in game
- Need to verify system events appear when tracing enabled
- Need to verify turn counter doesn't increment for trace commands

### Documentation Needs
- Update checklist to mark Phase 8 complete
- Create unit tests for TraceAction
- Document new trace command syntax for users

## Next Session Tasks

1. Complete testing of trace commands in Cloak of Darkness
2. Verify system events appear in output when tracing is enabled
3. Create unit tests for TraceAction
4. Update documentation with new command syntax
5. Verify AGAIN command doesn't repeat trace commands
6. Consider adding "trace all" as alias for completeness

## Technical Debt Notes

- Vocabulary is still duplicated in multiple places (stdlib and lang-en-us)
- Parser vocabulary loading could be more explicit
- Need better pattern support for VERB NOUN PARTICLE commands
- Consider centralizing all meta-command definitions
