# Session Summary - 2025-08-14 16:03

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive event system enhancements for the Sharpee interactive fiction engine, including trace/debug commands, granular parser and validation events, and game lifecycle events.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Trace Command System âœ…
- Added `trace` command to parser grammar with all variations (trace on/off, trace parser on/off, etc.)
- Fixed debug capability registration in WorldModel
- Commands now properly enable/disable debug event emission
- Debug flags stored in world capability: `debugParserEvents`, `debugValidationEvents`, `debugSystemEvents`

### 2. Enhanced Parser Debug Events âœ…
When `trace parser on`:
- **system.parser** - High-level parse result (action, pattern, confidence, token count)
- **system.parser.tokens** - Detailed tokenization with:
  - Word normalization
  - Parts of speech identification
  - Vocabulary candidates with confidence scores
- **system.parser.structure** - Command structure breakdown:
  - Verb phrase (text, head, particles)
  - Direct/indirect object noun phrases
  - Prepositions

### 3. Enhanced Validation Debug Events âœ…
When `trace validation on`:
- **system.validation.start** - Shows what's being validated
- **system.validation.success/failed** - Validation result with error details
- **system.validation.scope** - Entity scope information:
  - Scope level (carried, reachable, visible)
  - Which senses perceive the entity
- **system.validation.resolution** - Entity resolution details:
  - What text was parsed
  - Which entity ID was resolved
  - Entity name and location

### 4. Game Lifecycle Events âœ…
Implemented full game lifecycle event system:
- **game.story_loading** - Story being loaded
- **game.story_loaded** - Story ready with metadata
- **game.starting** - Game about to start
- **game.started** - Game running with session info
- **game.ending** - Game about to end
- **game.ended** - Game has ended
- **game.won** - Victory achieved
- **game.lost** - Defeat
- **game.quit** - Player quit
- **game.aborted** - Abnormal termination

### 5. Victory Detection System ðŸ”§
Implemented story-driven victory detection:
- Story emits `story.victory` event when win conditions met
- Engine detects victory event and triggers game end sequence
- Proper event flow: story domain event â†’ engine lifecycle events â†’ platform display

## Key Code Changes

### Files Modified
1. **packages/parser-en-us/src/core-grammar.ts** - Added trace command grammar
2. **packages/engine/src/command-executor.ts** - Enhanced debug event emission with granular details
3. **packages/core/src/events/game-events.ts** - New game lifecycle event definitions
4. **packages/engine/src/game-engine.ts** - Integrated game lifecycle events, victory detection
5. **stories/cloak-of-darkness/src/index.ts** - Added debug capability registration, victory event emission
6. **stories/cloak-of-darkness/run-platform.js** - Event listener setup and display

### Important Implementation Details

#### Debug Capability Registration
```typescript
// Must be registered in story initialization
world.registerCapability('debug', {
  schema: {
    debugParserEvents: { type: 'boolean', default: false },
    debugValidationEvents: { type: 'boolean', default: false },
    debugSystemEvents: { type: 'boolean', default: false }
  }
});
```

#### Victory Event Pattern
```typescript
// Story emits semantic event with proper structure
return [{
  id: `victory-${Date.now()}`,
  type: 'story.victory',
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  entities: {
    actor: this.world.getPlayer()?.id,
    target: message.id
  },
  data: {
    message: 'Congratulations! You have won!',
    reason: 'Message read without disturbing the sawdust',
    disturbances: this.disturbances
  }
}];
```

#### Event Listener Order
- Event listeners must be attached BEFORE engine.start() to catch initialization events
- Turn events include both game events and system debug events

## Technical Decisions

1. **No console.log()** - Removed all console.log debugging in favor of proper event system
2. **Event-driven victory** - Stories emit domain events, engine interprets them for lifecycle
3. **Turn numbering** - Starts at turn 1, increments after each non-meta command
4. **Debug granularity** - Comprehensive debug events for author troubleshooting

## Known Issues / Next Steps

1. **Quit command handling** - Platform events for quit confirmation need full implementation
2. **Save/Load events** - Session save/restore events defined but not fully integrated
3. **Platform I/O handlers** - Still pending implementation for file operations, dialogs
4. **Score tracking** - Victory events have score field but no scoring system yet

## Testing Status
- Trace commands working in Cloak of Darkness âœ…
- Parser/validation debug events displaying correctly âœ…
- Game start events emitting properly âœ…
- Victory detection functional (needs final build verification)
- Engine tests need updating for turn numbering changes

## Session End State
- All major event systems implemented and mostly functional
- Cloak of Darkness integrated with new debug and lifecycle events
- Ready for final testing and platform event handler implementation
