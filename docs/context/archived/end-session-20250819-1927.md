# Session Summary - August 19, 2025 19:27

## Session Overview
Investigated and designed solutions for two interactive fiction features requested by the intfiction.org community:
1. Dynamic state changes for objects (e.g., rag + water = wet rag)
2. Varying descriptions for objects

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Analyzed Current Architecture
- Reviewed ADR-051 (Action Behaviors) and ADR-052 (Event Handlers)
- Examined how entities, traits, and event handlers currently work
- Understood that text service queries entities, doesn't contain custom logic

### 2. Designed Solutions for Dynamic States and Descriptions

#### Initial Approach - StateTrait (Complex)
- Designed a StateTrait system for complex state machines
- Realized this was overkill for most use cases
- Moved to separate document as potential extension

#### Final Approach - Simple Attributes (Recommended)
- Use existing entity attributes for state storage
- Entity event handlers update state and descriptions
- Identity trait's description field is single source of truth
- Text service simply queries current description from world model

### 3. Created Documentation

#### Files Created/Modified:
1. **`docs/architecture/design/simple-state-approach.md`** (NEW)
   - Complete guide for attribute-based state management
   - Proper Sharpee entity creation examples
   - Shows wet rag, breakable mirror, temperature states

2. **`docs/architecture/design/state-trait-extension.md`** (NEW)
   - Complex StateTrait design for advanced cases
   - Combination locks, multi-step puzzles
   - Potential stdlib extension or separate package

3. **`docs/architecture/design/dynamic-state-and-descriptions.md`** (UPDATED)
   - Simplified to focus on recommended approach
   - Quick examples and key principles
   - References other docs for details

## Key Design Decisions

### What We Learned
1. **Simplicity wins**: Entity attributes + event handlers handle 90% of needs
2. **No custom text service logic**: Text service just queries entity descriptions
3. **Entities own their state**: They update their own descriptions when state changes
4. **Existing architecture is sufficient**: No new abstractions needed for most cases

### Architecture Flow
```
Event → Entity Handler → Update State/Description → Text Service Queries → Player Sees
```

### Example Implementation (Wet Rag)
```typescript
const rag = world.createEntity('rag', 'item');
rag.attributes.isWet = false;
rag.attributes.descriptions = {
  dry: 'A clean, dry rag.',
  wet: 'A soaking wet rag.'
};

rag.on = {
  'if.event.dipped': function(event) {
    if (event.data.targetIsLiquid) {
      this.attributes.isWet = true;
      this.get(TraitType.IDENTITY).description = this.attributes.descriptions.wet;
    }
  }
};
```

## Important Corrections Made
1. Fixed entity creation to use proper `world.createEntity()` syntax
2. Corrected event data structures to match Sharpee patterns
3. Removed arbitrary message keys - actions use proper semantic events
4. Clarified text service has no custom logic - just queries entities

## Next Steps Recommendations
1. Consider implementing example stories demonstrating these patterns
2. StateTrait could become `@sharpee/ext-state-machines` package
3. Document these patterns in author-facing documentation

## Technical Notes
- All examples now use proper Sharpee entity creation
- Event handlers don't emit arbitrary events - they update state
- Actions handle success/error messaging via semantic events
- Text service remains pure - no custom logic, just queries

## Summary
Successfully designed a simple, elegant solution for dynamic states and varying descriptions using Sharpee's existing architecture. The approach requires no new abstractions for 90% of use cases, keeping the system simple while remaining powerful.
