# Session Summary - 2025-08-10 20:30

## Session Overview
Successfully continued the stdlib action refactoring, implementing the validate/execute pattern with behavior delegation for 5 more actions: SwitchingOnAction, SwitchingOffAction, WearingAction, TakingOffAction, and DroppingAction.

## Actions Refactored This Session

### 1. SwitchingOnAction & SwitchingOffAction
- Refactored SwitchableBehavior to return result objects (SwitchOnResult, SwitchOffResult)
- Added validate() methods using SwitchableBehavior.canSwitchOn/Off()
- Refactored execute() to delegate state changes to SwitchableBehavior
- Preserved device-specific logic (lights, power, sounds, auto-off timers)
- Fixed pre-state capture for values that get reset (autoOffCounter, powerConsumption)

### 2. WearingAction & TakingOffAction
- Refactored WearableBehavior to return result objects (WearResult, RemoveResult)
- Added canRemove() validation method to WearableBehavior
- Implemented validate() methods using WearableBehavior.canWear/canRemove()
- Refactored execute() to delegate to WearableBehavior.wear/remove()
- Fixed test data to include wornBy field for proper validation
- Preserved layering and body part conflict logic

### 3. DroppingAction
- Added validate() method using ContainerBehavior.canAccept() for validation
- Refactored to use WearableBehavior.isWorn() for worn item checks
- Delegated container capacity checks to ContainerBehavior
- Updated tests to handle enhanced error parameters

## Key Design Patterns

### Result Objects Pattern
Extended to all refactored behaviors:
- SwitchableBehavior: SwitchOnResult, SwitchOffResult
- WearableBehavior: WearResult, RemoveResult
- Actions create events from these results
- Clean separation between state management and event creation

### Pre-State Capture Pattern
Some values must be captured before behavior execution:
- autoOffCounter (gets reset when switching off)
- powerConsumption (needed for powerFreed calculation)
- runningSound (needed for silence_falls message)

### Test Data Requirements
Tests must properly set up all required fields:
- wornBy must match actor.id for worn items
- This ensures WearableBehavior.canRemove() works correctly

## Test Results
All refactored actions pass their tests:
- switching_on-golden.test.ts: ✓ 23 tests
- switching_off-golden.test.ts: ✓ 23 tests
- wearing-golden.test.ts: ✓ 17 tests (1 skipped)
- taking_off-golden.test.ts: ✓ 17 tests
- dropping-golden.test.ts: ✓ 15 tests (2 skipped)

## Architecture Metrics Progress
From architectural debt test:
- **Behavior Usage Rate**: 11.4% (up from 9.1% at session start)
- **Direct Trait Manipulations**: 8 (unchanged)
- **Validation in Execute**: 5 (reduced from baseline)
- **Improvement**: +2.3% behavior usage this session

## Total Refactoring Progress
Actions successfully refactored with validate/execute pattern:
1. OpenAction ✅ (previous session)
2. CloseAction ✅ (previous session)
3. LockAction ✅ (previous session)
4. UnlockAction ✅ (previous session)
5. SwitchingOnAction ✅ (this session)
6. SwitchingOffAction ✅ (this session)
7. WearingAction ✅ (this session)
8. TakingOffAction ✅ (this session)
9. DroppingAction ✅ (this session)

**Total: 9 actions refactored**

## Files Modified

### Behaviors (world-model)
- `/packages/world-model/src/traits/switchable/switchableBehavior.ts`
  - Added SwitchOnResult and SwitchOffResult interfaces
  - Refactored methods to return result objects
  
- `/packages/world-model/src/traits/wearable/wearableBehavior.ts`
  - Added WearResult and RemoveResult interfaces
  - Added canRemove() validation method
  - Refactored methods to return result objects

### Actions (stdlib)
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/switching_on/switching_on.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/switching_off/switching_off.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/wearing/wearing.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/taking_off/taking-off.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/dropping/dropping.ts`

### Tests
- All corresponding test files updated with executeWithValidation helper
- Fixed test data for wearable items to include wornBy field

## Next Steps

Continue refactoring high-value actions:
1. **Taking action** - Use ContainerBehavior and PortableBehavior
2. **Examining action** - Aggregate information from multiple behaviors
3. **Container manipulation** (putting, inserting) - Use ContainerBehavior
4. **Support surface actions** - Use SupportBehavior

## Lessons Learned

### Test Data Completeness
Tests must set up complete trait data, not just the fields they're testing. Missing fields like `wornBy` can cause validation failures that are hard to debug.

### Behavior API Design
Some behaviors (like ContainerBehavior) only provide validation methods, not state-change methods that return results. This is fine - we can still use them for validation in the validate() phase.

### Error Parameter Consistency
When validation fails, the error parameters should match what the action's execute() would have provided. This may require special handling in test helpers.

## Summary
Excellent progress with 5 more actions refactored in this session, bringing the total to 9 actions using the validate/execute pattern with behavior delegation. The architecture is steadily improving with each refactored action, and the pattern is proving robust and maintainable.
