# Session Summary - 2025-08-10 16:00

## Session Overview
Successfully refactored the Action interface to implement a pure validate/execute separation pattern, fixing the architectural issues discovered in the previous session.

## Major Achievement: Pure Validate/Execute Pattern

### The Problem We Solved
In the previous session, we discovered that stdlib actions were completely bypassing the behavior system. Today we began the refactoring to fix this, but discovered a deeper design issue: the validate/execute pattern wasn't clearly defined.

### Initial Confusion
Started with confusion about whether execute() should:
1. Call validate() internally (seemed defensive)
2. Assume validate() was already called (seemed risky)
3. Have validation logic duplicated (obviously wrong)

### The Solution: Pure Separation
Established that Actions have **two completely separate methods**:
- `validate(context): ValidationResult` - Check preconditions, no side effects
- `execute(context): SemanticEvent[]` - Perform actions, assumes validation passed

The **CommandExecutor** orchestrates the flow, calling validate() then execute().

## Implementation Details

### 1. Updated Action Interface
```typescript
interface Action {
  validate(context: ActionContext): ValidationResult;
  execute(context: ActionContext): SemanticEvent[];
}
```

### 2. Refactored OpenableBehavior
Changed from returning events to returning result objects:
```typescript
interface OpenResult {
  success: boolean;
  alreadyOpen?: boolean;
  stateChanged?: boolean;
  openMessage?: string;
  openSound?: string;
  revealsContents?: boolean;
}
```

This avoids circular dependencies (world-model can't depend on stdlib).

### 3. Refactored OpenAction
- `validate()`: Checks entity exists, has required traits, uses behavior validation methods
- `execute()`: Assumes validation passed, delegates to behavior, creates events from results

### 4. Created Architecture Test
Built `validate-execute-pattern.test.ts` to enforce:
- Actions don't have validation logic in execute without calling validate
- No duplicate validation logic between validate() and execute()

### 5. Updated Tests
Tests now use a helper that mimics CommandExecutor:
```typescript
const executeWithValidation = (action, context) => {
  const validation = action.validate(context);
  if (!validation.valid) {
    return [/* error event */];
  }
  return action.execute(context);
};
```

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Result Objects Instead of Events?
Initially tried having behaviors return complete events (Option B), but hit circular dependency:
- stdlib depends on world-model
- Can't have world-model depend on stdlib's ActionContext

Solution: Behaviors return structured result objects, actions create events.

### Why Pure Separation?
- **No duplication**: Validation logic exists in exactly one place
- **Clean testing**: Can test validate() and execute() independently  
- **Clear responsibilities**: Each method has one job
- **No defensive programming**: Execute assumes validation passed

## Files Modified

### Created
- `/tests/architecture/validate-execute-pattern.test.ts` - Enforces the pattern
- `/docs/architecture/behavior-action-pattern-review.md` - Documents the full pattern

### Modified
- `/packages/world-model/src/traits/openable/openableBehavior.ts` - Returns result objects
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/opening/opening.ts` - Pure validate/execute
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/enhanced-types.ts` - Added ValidationResult type
- `/packages/engine/src/command-executor.ts` - Already had correct orchestration
- `/packages/stdlib/tests/unit/actions/opening-golden.test.ts` - Uses validation helper
- `/docs/work/stdlib-behavior-refactoring-plan.md` - Updated with design insights

## Metrics

### Tests
- All 12 opening action tests pass
- Architecture test detects 8 actions still needing refactoring

### Architecture Improvements
- OpenAction now properly delegates to OpenableBehavior
- Clear separation between validation and execution
- No more defensive checks in execute methods

## Next Steps

Continue refactoring remaining actions following the established pattern:
1. Update remaining behaviors to return result objects (LockableBehavior, etc.)
2. Refactor CloseAction, LockAction, UnlockAction
3. Eventually refactor all ~40 actions to use the pattern

## Lessons Learned

### Clear Separation Matters
The initial confusion about whether execute() should call validate() highlighted the importance of clear architectural boundaries. Pure separation (two methods, external orchestration) is cleaner than mixed approaches.

### Circular Dependencies Drive Design
The circular dependency issue forced us to use result objects instead of events, which turned out to be a cleaner design anyway.

### Tests Shape Architecture
The need to test actions in isolation revealed the importance of the pattern. Tests shouldn't need to know about orchestration logic.

## Summary

Successfully established and implemented the pure validate/execute pattern for actions. The pattern is now:
1. Clearly documented
2. Implemented in OpenAction
3. Enforced by architecture tests
4. Properly tested

This provides a solid foundation for refactoring the remaining ~39 actions to properly use the behavior system.
