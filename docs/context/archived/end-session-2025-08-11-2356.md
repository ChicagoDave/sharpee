# Session Summary - 2025-08-11 23:56

## Session Overview
Continued test remediation after ADR-051 implementation. Fixed all 6 failing tests in the turning action test suite by addressing validation pattern issues and incorrect worn item detection.

## Starting State
- 73 test failures remaining (from previous 121)
- Test pass rate at 92.7%
- Turning action had 6 failures related to undefined property errors
- Other pending: switching_on/off (10), opening/closing/locking (15), taking/dropping/wearing (20)

## Key Accomplishments

### Fixed Turning Action Tests (6/6 resolved)
Successfully fixed all turning action test failures:

1. **Added executeWithValidation helper**
   - Added missing helper function to simulate CommandExecutor flow
   - Pattern: validate() first, return error events if invalid, else execute()

2. **Fixed validation error handling**
   - Tests were calling `execute()` directly instead of using validation pattern
   - Updated all 6 failing tests to use `executeWithValidation`

3. **Fixed worn item detection bug**
   - Action was checking location instead of `isWorn` property
   - Changed from `wearableLocation === actor.id` to `wearable.isWorn`
   - Updated test to properly set `isWorn: true` on wearable items

4. **Added missing error params**
   - Added `params: { target: target.name }` to error responses
   - Ensures proper message formatting with entity names

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/turning/turning.ts`
  - Fixed worn item validation logic
  - Added params to error responses
  
- `/packages/stdlib/tests/unit/actions/turning-golden.test.ts`
  - Added executeWithValidation helper function
  - Updated all 6 failing tests to use proper validation pattern
  - Fixed worn item test setup

### Code Patterns Applied
```typescript
// Added helper function
function executeWithValidation(action: any, context: ActionContext): SemanticEvent[] {
  if (action.validate) {
    const validation = action.validate(context);
    if (!validation.valid) {
      return [context.event('action.error', {
        actionId: context.action.id,
        messageId: validation.error,
        params: validation.params || {}
      })];
    }
  }
  return action.execute(context);
}

// Fixed worn item check
// OLD: wearableLocation === actor.id
// NEW: wearable && wearable.isWorn
```

## Metrics
- **Tests fixed**: 6 (100% of turning failures resolved)
- **Files modified**: 2 (1 implementation, 1 test)
- **Remaining failures**: 67 (from 73)
- **Categories remaining**:
  - switching_on/off: 10 failures
  - opening/closing/locking: 15 failures  
  - taking/dropping/wearing: 20 failures
  - giving/throwing: 6 failures
  - Others: ~16 failures

## Next Session Recommendations
1. Apply same executeWithValidation pattern to switching_on/off tests
2. Check for similar worn item detection issues in other actions
3. Ensure all validation errors include proper params
4. Continue systematic test fixes in order of complexity
5. Run full test suite after each category of fixes

## Commands Used
- `pnpm --filter '@sharpee/stdlib' test turning` - Ran specific test suite
- No build commands needed (TypeScript changes only)
- Following CLAUDE.md instructions (no `2>&1` with pnpm)
