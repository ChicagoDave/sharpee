# Session Summary - August 18, 2025 20:19

## Session Overview
Successfully completed the interface refactoring PR and merged to main. Cleaned up test files, updated documentation, and prepared to continue work on the blood-magic extension.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Interface Refactoring PR Completed and Merged âœ…
- All packages building successfully with zero errors
- 2,721 tests passing with 0 failures
- Clean architectural separation achieved:
  - **Core**: Pure interfaces with I-prefix
  - **World-Model**: IF-specific implementations
  - **IF-Domain**: Domain contracts
  - **Stdlib**: Rich implementations with enhanced interfaces

### 2. Test Suite Cleanup
- Removed all `=== DEBUG INFO ===` blocks from test files
- Cleaned unnecessary console.log statements from:
  - `debug-worn-visibility.test.ts`
  - `world-model-debug.test.ts`
  - `scope-debug.test.ts`
  - `parser-integration.test.ts`
  - `debug-xyzzy.test.ts`
  - `verb-structure.test.ts`
  - `parser-extension.test.ts`
- Preserved intentional metric reporting in architecture tests

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Created comprehensive blog post: "Building a Flexible Interactive Fiction Engine: Extensions, Interfaces, and Semantic Grammar"
- Updated interface refactor checklist to reflect completed status
- Documented the successful architecture in `docs/work/interface-refactor-checklist.md`

### 4. Test Infrastructure
- Created test runner scripts (not committed):
  - `run-all-tests-parallel.sh` - Runs tests in dependency tiers
  - `run-all-tests-simple.sh` - Uses pnpm recursive
  - `run-all-tests-direct.sh` - Direct vitest execution
- Full test suite results saved to `logs/all-tests-20250818-1958.log`

### Key Architecture Decisions Validated
1. **Stdlib maintains rich interfaces** - Correct decision, provides needed functionality
2. **IEntity vs IFEntity layering** - Works perfectly for extension points
3. **Semantic grammar integration** - Clean and functional

## Git Operations
- Committed all changes with comprehensive message
- Pushed to `refactor/i-prefix-interfaces` branch
- PR successfully merged to main
- Branch deleted both locally and on GitHub
- Switched back to main with latest changes

## Next Steps: Blood-Magic Extension

### Current State
The blood-magic extension is located at `packages/extensions/blood-magic/` and includes:
- Mirror portal system (Blood of Silver)
- Invisibility mechanics (Blood of Moon)
- Traits: `mirrorTrait`, `bloodSilverTrait`, `bloodMoonTrait`
- Actions: `touchingMirror`, `enteringMirror`, `connectingMirrors`, etc.
- Unit and integration tests

### Immediate Tasks
1. Check if blood-magic builds with the new interface system
2. Complete the extension registration mechanism
3. Implement remaining features (rules, messages)
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Create example story using blood-magic

### Files to Focus On
- `/packages/extensions/blood-magic/src/index.ts` - Main extension definition
- `/packages/extensions/blood-magic/src/traits/` - Trait implementations
- `/packages/extensions/blood-magic/src/actions/` - Action implementations
- Integration with engine's extension system

## Session Metrics
- Duration: ~1.5 hours (19:35 - 20:19)
- Files modified: 27
- Tests cleaned: 7 test files
- Documentation created: 1 blog post, 1 session summary
- PR completed: Interface refactoring merged to main

## Summary
Major milestone achieved with the interface refactoring PR merged. The codebase now has a clean, well-organized architecture that's fully tested and documented. Ready to continue development on the blood-magic extension with a solid foundation in place.
