# Session Summary - 2025-08-10 18:30

## Session Overview
Successfully continued the stdlib action refactoring initiative, implementing the validate/execute pattern with behavior delegation for 2 additional critical actions: TakingAction and ExaminingAction. These are fundamental actions that handle object manipulation and information gathering.

## Actions Refactored This Session

### 1. TakingAction
- Added validate() method with comprehensive precondition checks
- Refactored to use multiple behaviors:
  - **SceneryBehavior**: Check if item can be taken (fixed in place)
  - **ActorBehavior**: Check carrying capacity for actors
  - **ContainerBehavior**: Check container capacity limits
  - **WearableBehavior**: Check if item is worn (needs removal first)
- Simplified execute() method by removing duplicate validation logic
- Fixed capacity checking to handle both ACTOR and CONTAINER traits properly
- Preserved all business logic (can't take self, rooms, scenery, etc.)

### 2. ExaminingAction
- Added validate() method for visibility and target checks
- Refactored to use behaviors for state queries:
  - **OpenableBehavior.isOpen()**: Check open/closed state
  - **SwitchableBehavior.isOn()**: Check device on/off state
  - **LockableBehavior.isLocked()**: Check lock status
  - **WearableBehavior.isWorn()**: Check if item is worn
- Information aggregation pattern - gathers data from multiple behaviors
- Preserved all trait-specific examination messages

## Technical Improvements

### Behavior Integration Patterns

#### 1. Validation Delegation
```typescript
// TakingAction uses multiple behaviors for validation
if (!ActorBehavior.canCarry(actor, noun, context.world)) {
  // Determine specific failure reason
}
```

#### 2. State Query Pattern
```typescript
// ExaminingAction queries behaviors for state
eventData.isOpen = OpenableBehavior.isOpen(noun);
eventData.isOn = SwitchableBehavior.isOn(noun);
```

#### 3. Capacity Check Ordering
```typescript
// Check CONTAINER trait first (common in tests)
if (actor.has(TraitType.CONTAINER)) { /* check container limits */ }
// Then check ACTOR trait for additional limits
if (actor.has(TraitType.ACTOR)) { /* check actor-specific limits */ }
```

## Test Coverage
All refactored actions passing their golden tests:
- `taking-golden.test.ts`: ✓ 18 tests (1 skipped)
- `examining-golden.test.ts`: ✓ 20 tests

## Architecture Metrics Progress

### Current Metrics
- **Behavior Usage Rate**: 15.9% (up from 11.4% at session start)
- **Direct Trait Manipulations**: 8 (stable)
- **Validation in Execute**: 5 (stable)
- **Improvement This Session**: +4.5% behavior usage

**Total: 11 actions refactored with validate/execute pattern**

## Key Files Modified

### Actions
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/taking/taking.ts`
  - Added validate() method with behavior delegation
  - Simplified execute() to remove duplicate validation
  
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/examining/examining.ts`
  - Added validate() method for visibility checks
  - Refactored to use behaviors for all state queries

### Tests
- `/packages/stdlib/tests/unit/actions/taking-golden.test.ts`
  - Added executeWithValidation helper
  
- `/packages/stdlib/tests/unit/actions/examining-golden.test.ts`
  - Added executeWithValidation helper

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Trait Priority in Validation
**Problem**: TakingAction failed when actor had both CONTAINER and ACTOR traits
**Solution**: Check CONTAINER trait first for capacity, then ACTOR for additional limits

### 2. Missing Behavior Methods
**Problem**: Some behaviors don't provide all needed methods
**Solution**: Fall back to trait access when behavior methods unavailable (e.g., readable text)

### 3. Information Aggregation
**Problem**: ExaminingAction needs data from many behaviors
**Solution**: Query pattern - use behaviors as read-only information sources

## Next Priority Actions

Based on usage frequency and architectural impact:
1. **PuttingAction** - Container manipulation with validation
2. **InsertingAction** - Similar to putting but for containers
3. **GoingAction** - Movement with exit/entry behaviors
4. **EnteringAction** - Container/supporter entry

## Architectural Insights

### What's Working Well
- Validate/execute pattern provides clean separation of concerns
- Behavior delegation significantly reduces code duplication
- Actions becoming simpler and more focused
- Test helper ensures consistent validation flow

### Patterns Emerging
- **Validation behaviors** - Check preconditions without state change
- **Query behaviors** - Provide information without mutation
- **Result objects** - Return structured data from state changes
- **Pre-state capture** - Save values before mutations

### Areas for Future Improvement
- Create more query methods in behaviors for read-only access
- Consider adding validation-specific methods to behaviors
- Standardize error reporting across all actions

## Session Impact

This session made significant progress:
- 2 critical actions refactored (taking and examining)
- 4.5% improvement in behavior usage metric
- Established patterns for complex multi-behavior actions
- Demonstrated information aggregation pattern

The refactoring continues to prove valuable with each action becoming cleaner, more testable, and properly delegating to the behavior system. The patterns established are accelerating the refactoring of remaining actions.
