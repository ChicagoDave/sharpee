# Work Session Summary - August 26, 2024 (Continuation)

## Session Overview
Continued the comprehensive design documentation effort for Sharpee interactive fiction engine actions, building on the previous session's work. Analyzed and documented 5 additional actions, bringing the total documented to approximately 24 of 35 actions.

## Actions Documented This Session
1. **locking-design.md** - Lock action with proper behavior delegation and key management
2. **looking-design.md** - Look action using three-phase pattern with report-heavy logic
3. **opening-design.md** - Open action migrated to three-phase pattern with atomic events
4. **pulling-design.md** - Complex pull action with extensive trait-based branching
5. **pushing-design.md** - Push action for buttons, heavy objects, and moveables

## Key Findings

### Positive Patterns Observed
1. **Proper Behavior Delegation** (locking):
   - Uses `LockableBehavior` correctly
   - Clean separation between validation and execution
   - No logic duplication

2. **Three-Phase Implementation** (looking, opening):
   - Proper validate/execute/report separation
   - Atomic event generation with snapshots
   - State preservation between phases

### Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. Severe Logic Duplication (pulling, pushing)
Both actions exhibit complete duplication of validation logic in execute:
- Entire switch statements repeated
- Event data rebuilt from scratch
- No state preservation between phases
- Maintenance nightmare - changes needed in two places

#### 2. Complexity Management Issues
- **pulling**: 600+ lines with deep nesting
- Multiple trait types creating branching complexity
- Mixed physics, mechanics, and UI concerns

#### 3. Design Inconsistencies
- Different message IDs between validate and execute phases
- Backward compatibility fields maintained alongside new structures
- Mixed event types (old and new patterns)

## Documentation Quality
Each design document includes:
- Complete message lists (10-40 messages per action)
- Detailed validation logic flows
- Comprehensive data structures
- Trait dependencies and interactions
- Current implementation critiques
- Specific improvement recommendations
- Usage examples with error cases

## Remaining Work
Approximately 11 actions still need documentation:
- quitting, reading, removing, restarting, restoring, saving
- scoring, searching, showing, sleeping, smelling

## Technical Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Refactor pulling/pushing**: Implement three-phase pattern to eliminate duplication
2. **Extract complexity**: Create behavior classes for complex trait interactions
3. **Standardize patterns**: Ensure all actions follow ADR-051 (three-phase)

### Architectural Improvements
1. **State preservation system**: Pass validation results through context
2. **Behavior delegation framework**: Centralize trait-based behaviors
3. **Physics engine**: Unified strength and force calculations
4. **Event consolidation**: Reduce event type proliferation

## Notable Implementation Patterns

### Well-Designed Actions
- **locking**: Clean behavior delegation, no duplication
- **looking**: Proper three-phase with minimal mutations
- **opening**: Successfully migrated to atomic events

### Problem Actions
- **pulling**: 600+ lines of duplicated complexity
- **pushing**: Similar duplication issues with inconsistent message IDs

## Files Created/Modified
- `/docs/packages/stdlib/requirements/locking-design.md`
- `/docs/packages/stdlib/requirements/looking-design.md`
- `/docs/packages/stdlib/requirements/opening-design.md`
- `/docs/packages/stdlib/requirements/pulling-design.md`
- `/docs/packages/stdlib/requirements/pushing-design.md`

## Next Session Priorities
1. Continue documenting remaining 11 actions
2. Create comparative analysis of implementation patterns
3. Develop refactoring plan for problem actions
4. Document common behavior classes

## Insights
The documentation process continues to reveal a clear divide between:
- **Modern implementations**: Following three-phase pattern with proper separation
- **Legacy implementations**: Heavy duplication and mixed concerns
- **Complex interactions**: Need for behavior extraction and state machines

The pulling and pushing actions particularly highlight the maintenance burden of duplicated logic and the need for systematic refactoring.
