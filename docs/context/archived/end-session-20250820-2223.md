# Session Summary - August 20, 2025 22:23

## Session Overview
Completed comprehensive analysis and planning for atomic events refactor to fix text service implementation issues and improve event sourcing architecture.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Text Service Architecture Design
- Created StandardTextService as translation layer between events and narrative
- Documented that text service SHOULD query world model (intentional design)
- Identified fundamental issue with ISemanticEvent interface

### 2. Core Problem Identified
- ISemanticEvent has three conflicting properties: `data`, `payload`, `metadata`
- `data` typed as `Record<string, unknown>` forces awkward double-casting
- 530 uses of `.data` vs 61 of `.payload` vs ~10 of `.metadata`

### 3. Architectural Analysis
- **Reference-based events (current)**: Small events with IDs, query world for details
- **Atomic events (proposed)**: Self-contained events with all data
- Key insight: Current system doesn't preserve history correctly - replaying events shows current state, not historical state

### 4. Solution Design
- Change `data` to type `unknown` (not `any`) for type safety
- Remove `payload` and `metadata` completely
- Make events atomic with snapshot data + optional provider functions
- Enables true event sourcing with historical accuracy

### 5. Implementation Plan Created
- Detailed 6-phase refactor plan
- Comprehensive checklist with ~100 tasks
- Estimated 15-22 hours of work
- Migration path maintains backward compatibility

## Key Decisions

### Type System Choice
- Use `unknown` not `any` for event data
- Forces intentional type assertions
- Single cast works: `event.data as RoomDescriptionData`
- Aligns with TypeScript best practices

### Atomic Events with Providers
```typescript
event = {
  type: 'examine.message',
  data: {
    disturbances: 0,  // Snapshot at event time
    getDescription: function() {
      if (this.disturbances === 0) return "Pristine message...";
      return "Trampled message...";
    }
  }
}
```

### Direct Property Removal
- Remove `payload` and `metadata` immediately
- No deprecation period - clean break
- Update all 61 payload references to use data

## Files Created/Modified

### Documentation
- `docs/assessment/core-data-assessment.md` - ISemanticEvent analysis
- `docs/assessment/atomic-events-analysis.md` - Architecture comparison
- `docs/assessment/atomic-events-with-providers.md` - Provider pattern design
- `docs/assessment/any-vs-unknown-analysis.md` - Type choice analysis
- `docs/design/text-service-logic.md` - Text service architecture
- `docs/work/atomic-events-refactor-plan.md` - Implementation plan
- `docs/work/atomic-events-checklist.md` - Detailed task list

### Code
- `packages/text-services/src/standard-text-service.ts` - New text service implementation
- `packages/text-services/src/index.ts` - Export StandardTextService

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 1**: Update ISemanticEvent interface
   - Change `data?: Record<string, unknown>` to `data?: unknown`
   - Remove payload and metadata properties
   - Update ~61 payload references

2. **Phase 2**: Migrate stdlib actions to emit atomic events
   - Start with looking.ts as pattern
   - Capture entity data at event time
   - Add provider functions for dynamic content

3. **Phase 3**: Update text service
   - Remove world model queries
   - Pure data transformation
   - Support provider functions

## Branch Status
- Created new branch: `refactor/atomic-events`
- Ready to begin implementation
- All analysis and planning committed to main

## Key Insights

1. **Historical Accuracy**: Current system violates event sourcing by showing current state instead of historical state when replaying events

2. **Type Safety**: The issue wasn't `any` vs `unknown`, it was `Record<string, unknown>` being too specific and forcing double-casts

3. **IF Requirements**: Interactive fiction needs dynamic descriptions, which atomic events can handle through provider functions

4. **Migration Strategy**: Can be done incrementally - fix types first, then gradually make events more atomic

## Session Impact
This refactor will fundamentally improve the architecture by:
- Fixing immediate TypeScript issues
- Enabling true event sourcing with historical accuracy
- Simplifying text service to pure transformation
- Providing clear separation of concerns
- Maintaining IF's need for dynamic content

The session successfully moved from identifying a type issue to discovering a fundamental architectural problem and designing a comprehensive solution.
