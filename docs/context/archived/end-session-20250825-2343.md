# Session Summary: Action Design Professional Reviews (Batch 3)
**Date**: 2025-08-26
**Duration**: ~15 minutes
**Focus**: Professional development reviews of stdlib action designs (actions 11-15)

## Work Completed

### Action Design Reviews Created
Completed comprehensive professional reviews for actions 11-15 from `docs/actions-list.txt`:

1. **exiting-review.md** - Score: 2/10
   - Worst score yet - intentional architectural violations
   - Comment admits to bypassing EntryBehavior (line 127)
   - Execute returns events (wrong signature)
   - Manual state mutations instead of behaviors
   - Missing report() phase entirely

2. **giving-review.md** - Score: 3.5/10
   - CRITICAL BUG: Doesn't actually transfer items!
   - Creates events saying item was given but never moves it
   - State reconstruction anti-pattern
   - Execute returns events (violation)
   - Complex validation wasted by broken execution

3. **going-review.md** - Score: 9.5/10
   - Near-perfect three-phase implementation
   - Exemplary behavior delegation
   - Comprehensive validation (darkness, locks, containment)
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Should be THE template for movement actions

4. **help-review.md** - Score: 3/10
   - Complete code duplication between validate/execute
   - Meta-action setting terrible example
   - validate() doesn't validate - just builds data
   - Execute returns events (wrong)
   - Dead code (unused interface)

5. **inventory-review.md** - Score: 2.5/10
   - WORST duplication in codebase: 106 lines repeated verbatim
   - validate() and execute() have identical implementations
   - Most severe DRY violation found
   - Execute returns events (wrong)
   - Catastrophic maintenance burden

## Critical Discoveries

### Worst Code Duplication Ever Found
```typescript
// Inventory action - 106 lines duplicated between methods
validate(context): ValidationResult {
    // Lines 59-165: Complex logic
    const carried = context.world.getContents(player.id);
    // ... 100+ more lines
}
execute(context): ISemanticEvent[] {
    // Lines 178-284: EXACT SAME LOGIC
}
```

### Critical Functional Bug
```typescript
// Giving action - forgets to actually give the item!
execute(context): ISemanticEvent[] {
    // Creates event saying item was given
    events.push(context.event('if.event.given', eventData));
    // BUT NEVER CALLS: context.world.moveEntity(item.id, recipient.id)
}
```

### Intentional Architecture Violation
```typescript
// Exiting action line 127 - developer knew better but did wrong
// Note: EntryBehavior.exit() returns events but we generate our own
// So we manually update the occupants
entryTrait.occupants!.splice(index, 1); // Manual mutation
```

### Template Excellence
```typescript
// Going action - perfect three-phase pattern
validate(): ValidationResult { /* checks only */ }
execute(): void { /* mutations only */ }  
report(): ISemanticEvent[] { /* events only */ }
```

## Quality Distribution Update

### Score Breakdown (All 15 Actions Reviewed)
- **9-10/10**: 4 actions (About, Closing, Examining, Going)
- **8-9/10**: 1 action (Dropping)
- **6-7/10**: 2 actions (Again, Entering)
- **3-4/10**: 5 actions (Attacking, Eating, Drinking, Giving, Help)
- **2-3/10**: 3 actions (Exiting, Inventory, Climbing)
- **Average**: 5.3/10 (declining trend)

### Batch Averages
- Batch 1 (1-5): 6.6/10
- Batch 2 (6-10): 6.35/10
- Batch 3 (11-15): 4.1/10 ⬇️

## Architectural Patterns

### Common Anti-Patterns Found
1. **Execute Returns Events**: 9 of 15 actions (60%)
2. **State Reconstruction**: 8 of 15 actions (53%)
3. **Missing Report Phase**: 9 of 15 actions (60%)
4. **Code Duplication**: 5 of 15 actions (33%)
5. **Manual State Mutations**: 6 of 15 actions (40%)

### Excellence Patterns
1. **Going**: Perfect complex action template
2. **Examining**: Perfect read-only template
3. **Closing**: Perfect state-change template
4. **About**: Perfect meta-action template

## Most Urgent Issues

### Priority 0: Game-Breaking Bugs
1. **Giving** doesn't transfer items (16 hour fix)

### Priority 1: Worst Technical Debt
1. **Inventory** 106-line duplication (14 hour fix)
2. **Exiting** intentional violations (18 hour fix)

### Priority 2: Bad Examples
1. **Help** meta-action with duplication (6 hour fix)

## Statistics Summary
- **Actions Reviewed**: 15 of 48 (31.25%)
- **Template Quality**: 4 (Going, Examining, Closing, About)
- **Needs Refactoring**: 2 (Again, Entering)
- **Needs Complete Rewrite**: 9 (60% of reviewed!)
- **Critical Bugs Found**: 1 (Giving)
- **Worst Duplication**: 106 lines (Inventory)

## Key Insights

### Quality Declining Over Time
- Early actions (About, Closing) show good patterns
- Middle actions show copy-paste spread
- Later actions show architectural confusion

### Duplication Crisis Expanding
- Eating/Drinking: 85% shared code
- Help: 100% logic duplication
- Inventory: 106 lines duplicated (worst yet)

### Pattern Understanding Varies
- Some developers understand three-phase (Going author)
- Others completely misunderstand (Inventory author)
- Some intentionally violate (Exiting author)

### Critical Bugs Hiding
- Giving action looks complex but doesn't work
- Validation passes but execution fails
- Testing likely only checks messages, not state

## Next Steps
1. **EMERGENCY**: Fix giving action's missing mutation
2. **URGENT**: Refactor inventory's 106-line duplication
3. Continue reviewing remaining 33 actions
4. Create linter rules to prevent execute() returning events
5. Establish Going as official movement template

## Session Notes
- Quality continues to decline (4.1/10 average)
- Found worst code duplication in project (106 lines)
- Found first critical functional bug (giving)
- Going action provides hope - near perfect implementation
- Pattern violations becoming more severe, not less
