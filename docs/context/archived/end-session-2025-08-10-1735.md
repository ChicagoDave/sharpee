# Session Summary - 2025-08-10 17:35

## Session Overview
Successfully continued the stdlib action refactoring initiative, implementing the validate/execute pattern with behavior delegation for 5 additional core actions. This session focused on device manipulation (switching) and wearable item management, plus container interactions.

## Refactoring Progress This Session

### Phase 1: Switching Actions (Device Manipulation)
**SwitchingOnAction & SwitchingOffAction**
- Modified SwitchableBehavior to return result objects instead of events
- Added SwitchOnResult and SwitchOffResult interfaces
- Implemented validate() methods using SwitchableBehavior.canSwitchOn/Off()
- Delegated state changes to SwitchableBehavior.switchOn/Off()
- Preserved complex device logic (light sources, power requirements, auto-off timers)
- Fixed pre-state capture pattern for values that reset on state change

### Phase 2: Wearable Actions (Clothing Management)
**WearingAction & TakingOffAction**
- Refactored WearableBehavior to return WearResult and RemoveResult objects
- Added canRemove() validation method to WearableBehavior
- Implemented validate() methods for both actions
- Delegated state changes to WearableBehavior.wear/remove()
- Preserved layering logic and body part conflict checking
- Fixed critical test data issue: missing wornBy field

### Phase 3: Container Interaction
**DroppingAction**
- Implemented validate() method using ContainerBehavior.canAccept()
- Integrated WearableBehavior.isWorn() for worn item validation
- Delegated container capacity checks to ContainerBehavior
- Maintained support for various drop locations (room, container, supporter)

## Technical Improvements

### Behavior Result Objects Pattern
Extended the result object pattern to all behaviors:
```typescript
// Before: Behaviors returned events
static switchOn(entity: IFEntity, actor: IFEntity): SemanticEvent[]

// After: Behaviors return result objects
static switchOn(entity: IFEntity): SwitchOnResult {
  success: boolean;
  wasOn?: boolean;
  noPower?: boolean;
  autoOffTime?: number;
  // ... other relevant data
}
```

### Pre-State Capture Pattern
Discovered critical timing issue with state mutations:
```typescript
// Must capture values BEFORE behavior execution
const hadAutoOff = switchableData.autoOffCounter > 0;
const remainingTime = switchableData.autoOffCounter;
const result = SwitchableBehavior.switchOff(noun); // Resets autoOffCounter
```

### Test Data Completeness
Identified and fixed missing data in tests:
```typescript
// Before: Missing wornBy field caused validation failures
hat.add({
  type: TraitType.WEARABLE,
  worn: true,
  bodyPart: 'head'
});

// After: Complete data for proper validation
hat.add({
  type: TraitType.WEARABLE,
  worn: true,
  wornBy: player.id,  // Critical for WearableBehavior.canRemove()
  bodyPart: 'head'
});
```

## Test Coverage
All refactored actions passing tests:
- `switching_on-golden.test.ts`: ✓ 23 tests
- `switching_off-golden.test.ts`: ✓ 23 tests  
- `wearing-golden.test.ts`: ✓ 16 tests (1 skipped)
- `taking_off-golden.test.ts`: ✓ 17 tests
- `dropping-golden.test.ts`: ✓ 15 tests (2 skipped)

**Total: 94 passing tests**

## Architecture Metrics

### Improvement Metrics
- **Behavior Usage**: 9.1% → 11.4% (+2.3%)
- **Direct Trait Manipulations**: 8 (stable)
- **Validation in Execute**: 5 (reduced from baseline)
- **Code Duplication**: Reduced by ~130 lines

### Actions Refactored to Date
1. OpenAction ✅
2. CloseAction ✅
3. LockAction ✅
4. UnlockAction ✅
5. SwitchingOnAction ✅ (NEW)
6. SwitchingOffAction ✅ (NEW)
7. WearingAction ✅ (NEW)
8. TakingOffAction ✅ (NEW)
9. DroppingAction ✅ (NEW)

## Key Files Modified

### Behaviors
- `/packages/world-model/src/traits/switchable/switchableBehavior.ts`
- `/packages/world-model/src/traits/wearable/wearableBehavior.ts`

### Actions
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/switching_on/switching_on.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/switching_off/switching_off.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/wearing/wearing.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/taking_off/taking-off.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/dropping/dropping.ts`

### Tests
- All corresponding test files updated with executeWithValidation helper
- Fixed 14 test data instances missing wornBy field

## Challenges Overcome

### 1. Test Failures Due to Incomplete Data
**Problem**: Tests were failing because WearableBehavior.canRemove() checked wornBy field
**Solution**: Updated all test fixtures to include complete trait data

### 2. State Mutation Timing
**Problem**: Some values needed for events were reset by behavior methods
**Solution**: Implemented pre-state capture pattern to save values before mutation

### 3. Error Parameter Consistency
**Problem**: Test helper wasn't providing correct params for certain errors
**Solution**: Added special handling for container_full and other contextual errors

## Next Priority Actions

Based on impact and usage frequency:
1. **TakingAction** - High usage, involves multiple behaviors
2. **ExaminingAction** - Information aggregation from all behaviors
3. **PuttingAction** - Container manipulation
4. **InsertingAction** - Container insertion logic

## Architectural Insights

### What's Working Well
- Result object pattern provides clean separation of concerns
- Validate/execute split makes actions more testable
- Behavior delegation significantly reduces code duplication
- Test helper (executeWithValidation) ensures consistent validation

### Areas for Improvement
- Some behaviors (ContainerBehavior) lack state-mutation methods
- Need better documentation of required trait fields
- Consider adding TypeScript interfaces for trait data

## Session Impact
This session made significant progress in the refactoring initiative:
- 5 more actions converted to the new pattern
- 2.3% improvement in behavior usage metric
- Established patterns that will accelerate future refactoring
- Identified and fixed systemic test data issues

The refactoring is proving its value with each converted action becoming simpler, more maintainable, and properly delegating to the behavior system as originally intended.
