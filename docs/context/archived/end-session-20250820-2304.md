# Session Summary - August 20, 2025 23:04

## Session Overview
Successfully completed Phase 1 of the atomic events refactor, fixing the fundamental type issues with ISemanticEvent and laying groundwork for true event sourcing with atomic events.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Core Interface Refactor
- Changed `ISemanticEvent.data` from `Record<string, unknown>` to `unknown`
- Removed `payload` and `metadata` properties from interface
- Eliminated double-casting issues throughout codebase

### 2. Codebase Migration
- Updated ~61 references from `.payload` to `.data`
- Added proper type assertions using `event.data as TypeName`
- Maintained backward compatibility for IPlatformEvent (special payload structure)

### 3. Event Builder Infrastructure
Created new event builder classes in `packages/core/src/events/builders/`:
- **EventBuilder.ts**: Base class with fluent API for building events
- **RoomDescriptionEventBuilder.ts**: Specialized for room description events
- **ActionEventBuilder.ts**: For action success/failure events
- **EntitySnapshotBuilder.ts**: For capturing entity state snapshots

### 4. Files Modified
- **Core Package**: 
  - Updated types, event-system, query-manager
  - Fixed test files to use new structure
  - All tests passing
- **Engine Package**: 
  - Updated game-engine.ts for backward compatibility
- **Stdlib Package**: 
  - Updated witness-system, looking action
  - Fixed test utilities
- **Text Services**: 
  - Updated template services for compatibility

## Technical Details

### Before (Problem)
```typescript
// Old interface forced awkward double-casting
interface ISemanticEvent {
  payload?: Record<string, unknown>;
  data?: Record<string, unknown>;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
}

// Required double-casting
const roomData = (event.data as any)?.data as RoomDescriptionData;
```

### After (Solution)
```typescript
// New interface with flexible data
interface ISemanticEvent {
  data?: unknown;
  // payload and metadata removed
}

// Single, clean type assertion
const roomData = event.data as RoomDescriptionData;
```

### Event Builder Example
```typescript
const event = new RoomDescriptionEventBuilder()
  .withRoom('library', 'Grand Library', 'A magnificent library...')
  .withContents([
    { id: 'book1', name: 'Ancient Tome' }
  ])
  .withActor('player')
  .build();
```

## Testing Results
- ✅ Core package: All 120 tests passing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors
- ✅ Build successful

## Git Status
- Branch: `refactor/atomic-events`
- Commit: `30b96fb` - "feat: Complete Phase 1 of atomic events refactor"
- Pushed to origin

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. **Update stdlib actions** to emit atomic events with entity snapshots
2. **Start with looking.ts** as the pattern example
3. **Update text service** to use event data instead of querying world
4. **Add provider functions** for dynamic content

## Key Insights

1. **Type Safety Win**: Moving from `Record<string, unknown>` to `unknown` provides better TypeScript ergonomics - one explicit cast is clearer than navigating nested unknowns

2. **Platform Events Special Case**: IPlatformEvent extends ISemanticEvent but overrides with its own typed payload - this is intentional and correct

3. **Incremental Migration**: The refactor allows gradual migration - old code works with type assertions while new code can use builders

## Session Impact
This refactor fundamentally improves the event system by:
- Fixing immediate TypeScript friction
- Enabling true event sourcing with historical accuracy  
- Providing clean foundation for atomic events
- Maintaining full backward compatibility during migration

Phase 1 complete and stable. Ready for Phase 2 implementation.
