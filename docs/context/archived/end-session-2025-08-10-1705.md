# Session Summary - 2025-08-10 18:00

## Session Overview
Successfully continued the stdlib action refactoring to implement the validate/execute pattern with behavior delegation for 2 more core actions: SwitchingOnAction and SwitchingOffAction.

## Actions Refactored This Session

### 1. SwitchingOnAction
- Refactored SwitchableBehavior to return SwitchOnResult objects instead of events
- Added validate() method using SwitchableBehavior.canSwitchOn()
- Refactored execute() to delegate state changes to SwitchableBehavior.switchOn()
- Updated tests to use executeWithValidation helper
- Preserved all device-specific logic (light sources, power, sounds)

### 2. SwitchingOffAction  
- Refactored SwitchableBehavior to return SwitchOffResult objects
- Added validate() method using SwitchableBehavior.canSwitchOff()
- Refactored execute() to delegate to SwitchableBehavior.switchOff()
- Fixed data capture to read values before state change (autoOffCounter, powerConsumption)
- Updated tests with executeWithValidation helper

## Key Design Improvements

### Result Objects Pattern Extended
Continued the established pattern for SwitchableBehavior:
- `SwitchOnResult` with success, wasOn, noPower, autoOffTime, etc.
- `SwitchOffResult` with success, wasOff, offSound, offMessage
- Actions create events from these results
- Clean separation between state management and event creation

### Pre-State Capture Pattern
Discovered that some values need to be captured BEFORE the behavior executes:
- `autoOffCounter` gets reset to 0 when switching off
- `powerConsumption` needs to be read to calculate `powerFreed`
- Solution: Read these values before calling the behavior

## Test Results
All refactored actions pass their tests:
- switching_on-golden.test.ts: ✓ 23 tests
- switching_off-golden.test.ts: ✓ 23 tests

## Architecture Metrics Update
From architectural debt test:
- **Behavior Usage Rate**: 9.1% (up from baseline)
- **Direct Trait Manipulations**: 8 (reduced from baseline)
- **Validation in Execute**: 3 (reduced)
- **Estimated Duplicated Lines**: 130 (reduced by 60 lines)

## Total Progress
Actions successfully refactored with validate/execute pattern:
1. OpenAction ✅
2. CloseAction ✅
3. LockAction ✅
4. UnlockAction ✅
5. SwitchingOnAction ✅ (NEW)
6. SwitchingOffAction ✅ (NEW)

## Files Modified

### Behaviors
- `/packages/world-model/src/traits/switchable/switchableBehavior.ts`
  - Added SwitchOnResult and SwitchOffResult interfaces
  - Refactored switchOn() and switchOff() to return result objects
  - Updated toggle() to work with result objects
  - Removed actor parameter from methods (not needed for state change)

### Actions
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/switching_on/switching_on.ts`
  - Added validate() method
  - Refactored execute() to use SwitchableBehavior.switchOn()
  - Preserved all special logic for lights, power, sounds
  
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/switching_off/switching_off.ts`
  - Added validate() method
  - Refactored execute() to use SwitchableBehavior.switchOff()
  - Added pre-state capture for autoOffCounter and powerConsumption

### Tests
- `/packages/stdlib/tests/unit/actions/switching_on-golden.test.ts`
  - Added executeWithValidation helper
  
- `/packages/stdlib/tests/unit/actions/switching_off-golden.test.ts`
  - Added executeWithValidation helper

## Next Steps

Continue refactoring the remaining high-impact actions:
1. **Wearable actions** (wearing, taking_off) - Use WearableBehavior
2. **Container actions** (dropping, taking) - Use ContainerBehavior  
3. **Information actions** (examining) - Aggregate behavior info

## Lessons Learned

### State Capture Timing
Some data must be captured before calling behaviors that modify state. This is especially true for:
- Counter values that get reset
- State that affects event data but gets cleared
- Values needed for "diff" calculations (like powerFreed)

### Test Helper Consistency
All refactored actions need the `executeWithValidation` helper in their tests to properly simulate the CommandExecutor flow. This ensures validate() is called before execute().

### Behavior Simplification
Behaviors don't always need the `actor` parameter if they're just changing state. The action can handle actor-specific logic when creating events.

## Summary
Made excellent progress refactoring 2 more core actions to the validate/execute pattern. The pattern continues to prove robust and effective at reducing code duplication and improving architecture. Tests are passing and the codebase is becoming cleaner with each refactored action.
