# Session Summary - 2025-08-10 17:45

## Session Overview
Successfully continued the stdlib action refactoring to implement the validate/execute pattern with behavior delegation for 3 more core actions: CloseAction, LockAction, and UnlockAction.

## Actions Refactored This Session

### 1. CloseAction
- Added validate() method to check preconditions using OpenableBehavior.canClose()
- Refactored execute() to delegate state changes to OpenableBehavior.close()
- Updated tests to use executeWithValidation helper
- Fixed test data to explicitly set canClose: true

### 2. LockAction  
- Refactored LockableBehavior to return LockResult objects instead of events
- Added canLock() and canUnlock() validation methods to LockableBehavior
- Implemented validate() method using behavior validation methods
- Refactored execute() to delegate to LockableBehavior.lock()
- Updated tests with executeWithValidation helper

### 3. UnlockAction
- Refactored to use UnlockResult from LockableBehavior
- Implemented validate() method with key validation using canUnlockWith()
- Refactored execute() to delegate to LockableBehavior.unlock()
- Updated tests with executeWithValidation helper

## Key Design Improvements

### LockableBehavior Flexibility
Made OPENABLE trait optional in LockableBehavior since some items (like padlocks) can be lockable without being openable. The behavior now checks for OPENABLE trait only when needed.

### Result Objects Pattern
Continued the pattern established in previous session:
- Behaviors return result objects (OpenResult, CloseResult, LockResult, UnlockResult)
- Actions create events from these results
- Clean separation between state management (behaviors) and event creation (actions)

## Test Results
All refactored actions pass their tests:
- opening-golden.test.ts: ✓ 12 tests
- closing-golden.test.ts: ✓ 13 tests  
- locking-golden.test.ts: ✓ 19 tests
- unlocking-golden.test.ts: ✓ 13 tests (9 skipped)

## Architecture Status
The validate-execute pattern is now implemented in:
1. OpenAction ✓
2. CloseAction ✓
3. LockAction ✓
4. UnlockAction ✓

Still showing technical debt (8 actions):
- dropping.ts
- examining.ts
- switching_off.ts
- switching_on.ts
- taking_off.ts
- wearing.ts
- Plus defensive checks in locking.ts and unlocking.ts (acceptable)

## Files Modified

### Behaviors
- `/packages/world-model/src/traits/lockable/lockableBehavior.ts`
  - Added LockResult and UnlockResult interfaces
  - Refactored lock() and unlock() to return result objects
  - Added canLock() and canUnlock() validation methods
  - Made OPENABLE trait optional

### Actions
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/closing/closing.ts`
  - Added validate() method
  - Refactored execute() to use behavior delegation
  
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/locking/locking.ts`
  - Added validate() method with key validation
  - Refactored execute() to use LockableBehavior.lock()
  
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/unlocking/unlocking.ts`
  - Added validate() method with key validation
  - Refactored execute() to use LockableBehavior.unlock()

### Tests
- `/packages/stdlib/tests/unit/actions/closing-golden.test.ts`
  - Added executeWithValidation helper
  - Fixed test data to include canClose: true
  
- `/packages/stdlib/tests/unit/actions/locking-golden.test.ts`
  - Added executeWithValidation helper
  
- `/packages/stdlib/tests/unit/actions/unlocking-golden.test.ts`
  - Added executeWithValidation helper

## Next Steps

Continue refactoring the remaining actions:
1. Switch actions (switching_on, switching_off) - Use SwitchableBehavior
2. Wearable actions (wearing, taking_off) - Use WearableBehavior  
3. Container actions (dropping, taking, putting) - Use ContainerBehavior
4. Information actions (examining) - Aggregate behavior info

## Lessons Learned

### Trait Dependencies
Not all behaviors need all their "related" traits. LockableBehavior works fine without OPENABLE for items that are just lockable.

### Test Data Precision
Tests need to explicitly set trait properties that behaviors check (like canClose) rather than relying on defaults.

### Defensive Checks vs Validation
It's okay to have defensive checks in execute() for behavior failures - these aren't validation duplication, they're safety nets for unexpected states.

## Summary
Made solid progress refactoring 3 more core actions to the validate/execute pattern. The pattern is proving robust and the behavior delegation is working well. Tests are passing and the architecture is improving with each refactored action.
