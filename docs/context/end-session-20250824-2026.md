# Session Summary - August 24, 2025, 20:26

## Session Overview
Fixed multiple test failures in the engine package related to the three-phase action pattern (validate/execute/report) implementation. Read and understood ADRs 58-62 to properly implement the atomic events refactor.

## Key Issues Addressed

### Issue 1: CommandExecutor Timing Data Not Collected
**Problem**: The CommandExecutor wasn't collecting timing data when `config.collectTiming` was set to true.

**Solution**: Modified CommandExecutor to track parsing and execution times when timing is enabled:
- Added timing variables to track parseTime and executionTime
- Populated result.timing object with parsing, execution, and total times
- Applied timing even in error cases

**Files Modified**:
- `packages/engine/src/command-executor.ts`

### Issue 2: Entity Duplicate Trait Warning
**Problem**: Entities could have the same trait added multiple times, causing silent bugs.

**Solution**: Modified IFEntity.add() to warn and ignore duplicate trait additions instead of silently replacing:
- Added console.warn when trait already exists
- Returns early without replacing existing trait
- Prevents accidental trait overwrites

**Files Modified**:
- `packages/world-model/src/entities/if-entity.ts`

### Issue 3: Taking Action Not Moving Items
**Problem**: The taking action was failing with `cant_take` error even when validation passed.

**Root Cause**: `ActorBehavior.takeItem()` only validates but doesn't actually move the entity. It returns a result object indicating whether the move is valid, but the actual `world.moveEntity()` call was missing.

**Solution**: Modified the taking action's execute method to actually move the entity:
```typescript
// Old: ActorBehavior.takeItem(actor, noun, context.world);
// New:
context.world.moveEntity(noun.id, actor.id);
```

**Files Modified**:
- `packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/taking/taking.ts`

### Issue 4: Event Type Normalization
**Problem**: Event types were using underscores instead of dots (e.g., `room_description` instead of `room.description`).

**Solution**: Updated looking action to use dots in event types:
- Changed `if.event.room_description` to `if.event.room.description`
- Changed `if.event.list_contents` to `if.event.list.contents`
- Updated corresponding type definitions

**Files Modified**:
- `packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/looking/looking.ts`
- `packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/looking/looking-events.ts`

### Issue 5: Test Story Setup Issues
**Problem**: MinimalTestStory was trying to add traits that entities already had from `createEntityWithTraits()`.

**Solution**: Cleaned up MinimalTestStory to:
- Use `createEntityWithTraits()` for proper default trait setup
- Removed duplicate ActorTrait addition (already added by createEntityWithTraits)
- Fixed room connections using `RoomBehavior.setExit()`
- Added test objects (lamp, box) for testing

**Files Modified**:
- `packages/engine/tests/stories/minimal-test-story.ts`

## Understanding the Three-Phase Pattern

From ADRs 58-62, learned the proper implementation of the three-phase action pattern:

1. **Validate Phase**: Check if action can be performed
2. **Execute Phase**: Perform state mutations only
3. **Report Phase**: Generate ALL events (success, errors, etc.)

Key insights:
- Actions own ALL their event generation in the report() function
- CommandExecutor is just a thin orchestrator (~100 lines)
- Behaviors (like ActorBehavior) validate but don't mutate
- Entity snapshots in events are a known code smell (ADR-061) to be fixed later

## Technical Details

### CommandExecutor Refactor Goals (ADR-060)
- Reduce from 700+ lines to ~100 lines
- Only orchestrate phases, don't create events
- Let components own their event creation

### Action Customization (ADR-059)
- Actions implement all three phases atomically
- Stories can extend event data but not replace phases
- Data builder functions create consistent event structures

### Code Smells Identified (ADR-061)
- Entity snapshot pattern has data clumping
- Feature envy with actions reaching into entities
- Will be addressed in future refactor

## Test Results
- Fixed 5 major test failures in CommandExecutor tests
- Fixed historical accuracy test to actually execute taking action
- Remaining failures are mostly about entity snapshot structure (known issue)

## Commits Created
- Multiple file modifications to fix test failures
- All changes aligned with three-phase pattern architecture

## Status
- Branch: main
- Tests significantly improved but not all passing
- Ready for entity snapshot refactor (ADR-061) in future session
- Three-phase pattern properly understood and partially implemented
