## Issue Resolved
Fixed build errors in the event-processor package caused by references to the deleted ENTRY trait.

## Changes Made

### packages/event-processor/src/handlers/movement.ts
- Removed all references to `TraitType.ENTRY` from the `handleEntered` function
- Removed all references to `TraitType.ENTRY` from the `handleExited` function  
- Cleaned up the logic to simply move actors to their new locations without updating non-existent ENTRY trait occupants

## Build Status
- event-processor package: ✅ Building successfully

## Context
The ENTRY trait was previously deleted from the codebase, but the event-processor movement handlers still contained references to it, causing TypeScript compilation errors. The handlers were simplified to just perform the basic movement operations without the ENTRY trait bookkeeping.
