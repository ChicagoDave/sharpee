# Session Context Summary
**Date**: 2025-08-06 14:30
**Branch**: main
**Focus**: Entity type migration completion and architecture refactoring planning

## Session Overview
Continued from previous session's entity type migration work. Reduced test failures from 81-83 down to 21, then identified architectural issues with dynamic loading causing test timeouts and complexity.

## Work Completed

### 1. Test Failure Reduction
- **Starting point**: 81-83 test failures in engine package
- **Ending point**: 21 test failures
- **Fixed**:
  - Jest → Vitest references (vi)
  - Mock language provider implementation
  - Text service build and loading issues
  - Query event emission (3 of 5 tests)
  - Language code consistency (en → en-us)
  - Command executor timing data

### 2. Key Files Modified
- `/packages/engine/tests/integration/query-system.test.ts` - Fixed async handling, mock setup
- `/packages/engine/src/game-engine.ts` - Skip text service loading if already set
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/quitting/quitting.ts` - Added client.query event emission
- `/packages/text-services/` - Created test suite (7 passing tests)
- `/packages/engine/tests/test-helpers/setup-test-engine.ts` - Created to bypass dynamic imports

### 3. Architecture Decisions
- **ADR-048**: Static language/parser/text-service architecture
  - Eliminate dynamic imports
  - Build-time language configuration
  - Platform-specific entry points
  - Direct dependency injection

### 4. Documentation Created
- `/docs/architecture/adr-048-static-language-architecture.md`
- `/docs/work/dynamic-load-refactoring.md` - 100+ item checklist

## Remaining Issues

### Test Failures (21 total)
1. **Command History (8)**: Wrong actionId being recorded
2. **Platform Operations (7)**: Quit hooks not being called  
3. **Text Output Channel (4)**: Architecture mismatch
4. **Query System (2)**: Quit cancellation, invalid responses

### Root Cause
Dynamic loading of language/parser/text-service causing:
- Test timeouts and hangs
- Complex async initialization
- Lost type safety
- Unnecessary runtime flexibility

## Next Session Tasks

### Immediate (if continuing current approach)
1. Fix command history actionId tracking
2. Fix remaining query system tests
3. Fix platform operation tests
4. Fix text output channel tests

### Recommended (architectural refactor)
1. Create feature branch for static architecture
2. Start Phase 1 of `/docs/work/dynamic-load-refactoring.md`
3. Create platform packages structure
4. Build test platform first to validate approach

## Key Insights
- Dynamic loading is solving wrong problem - IF games ship as complete executables, not runtime-configurable apps
- Tests hanging on `await engine.setStory(story)` due to dynamic imports
- Platform events need platform-specific handling, not generic abstraction
- Build-time configuration will eliminate most test complexity

## File Inventory
### Modified (uncommitted)
```
M build-test-all.sh
M packages/engine/src/game-engine.ts
M packages/engine/tests/integration/command-history.test.ts
M packages/engine/tests/integration/query-system.test.ts
M packages/stdlib/src/validation/command-validator.ts
M packages/stdlib/tests/unit/actions/entering-golden.test.ts
[... and others per git status]
```

### Created
```
packages/engine/tests/integration/query-events.test.ts
packages/engine/tests/test-helpers/setup-test-engine.ts
packages/text-services/tests/text-services.test.ts
docs/architecture/adr-048-static-language-architecture.md
docs/work/dynamic-load-refactoring.md
```

## Commands/Aliases Used
- Test runs with timeout: `timeout 30 npx vitest run [test]`
- Avoiding '2>&1' issue that causes vitest filter problems
- Direct imports in tests to bypass dynamic loading

## Context for Next Session
Start with: "Continuing from session 2025-08-06-1430. Ready to begin static architecture refactoring per ADR-048 and checklist in /docs/work/dynamic-load-refactoring.md. Currently 21 test failures remain but architectural refactor will address root causes."
