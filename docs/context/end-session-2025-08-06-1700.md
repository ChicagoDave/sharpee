# Session End Context - 2025-08-06 17:00

## Session Summary
Continued static architecture refactoring from session 2025-08-06-1528. Made significant progress fixing test failures from the removal of dynamic loading functions.

## Current State

### Test Status
- Initial state: 126 test failures (from previous session)
- Current state: ~83 test failures remaining
- Main issues:
  1. Command executor tests still referencing removed functions (26 failures)
  2. Command history integration tests have logic issues (7 failures)  
  3. Query system integration tests have event issues (2 failures)
  4. Game engine language tests have EventProcessor initialization issues (5 failures)

### Files Modified

#### Successfully Fixed
1. **packages/engine/tests/test-helpers/setup-test-engine.ts**
   - Fixed parser constructor: `new EnglishParser(languageProvider, { world })`
   - Now provides static dependencies for all tests

2. **packages/engine/tests/story.test.ts**
   - Removed `language` field from StoryConfig
   - Deleted `loadLanguageProvider` tests
   - All tests passing

3. **packages/engine/tests/game-engine.test.ts**
   - Replaced `createStandardEngine()` with `setupTestEngine()`
   - Fixed `getTextOutputService()` to `getTextService()`
   - 19/25 tests passing (was 0/25)

4. **packages/engine/tests/integration.test.ts**
   - Complete rewrite using `setupTestEngine()`
   - All 13 test cases updated

5. **packages/engine/tests/platform-operations.test.ts**
   - Updated all 19 test cases to use `setupTestEngine()`
   - Removed async from story setup

6. **packages/engine/tests/integration/query-events.test.ts**
   - Replaced factory functions with `setupTestEngine()`
   - Fixed to use static imports

#### Partially Fixed
1. **packages/engine/tests/command-executor.test.ts**
   - Updated imports to use `setupTestEngine()`
   - Removed `loadLanguageProvider` imports
   - Still has 26 failures (needs more work)

2. **packages/engine/tests/story-testing-verification.test.ts**
   - Updated to use static imports
   - Replaced dynamic loading with `new EnglishLanguageProvider()`

### Key Pattern Changes

#### Before (Dynamic Loading)
```typescript
const engine = createStandardEngine();
const languageProvider = await loadLanguageProvider('en-us');
await engine.setStory(story);
```

#### After (Static Imports)
```typescript
const { engine, world, player, languageProvider, parser } = setupTestEngine();
engine.setStory(story); // No longer async
```

### Remaining Work

1. **Fix Command Executor Tests (26 failures)**
   - Complete removal of dynamic imports
   - Update to use setupTestEngine() pattern

2. **Fix Command History Tests (7 failures)**
   - Logic issues with command tracking
   - Event emission problems

3. **Fix Query System Tests (2 failures)**
   - Missing event emissions
   - Query cancellation not working

4. **Fix Game Engine Language Tests (5 failures)**
   - EventProcessor initialization issues
   - World model registration problems

5. **Clean up test utilities**
   - Remove deprecated functions from fixtures/index.ts
   - Update test-setup.ts to remove old mocking code

## Next Session Tasks

1. Complete test fixes (priority order):
   - Command executor tests
   - Command history integration
   - Query system integration
   - Game engine language tests

2. Run full test suite and ensure all pass

3. Update documentation:
   - Complete migration guide
   - Update API documentation
   - Add examples for new static pattern

## Important Notes

- Static architecture refactoring is functionally complete
- All production code updated to new patterns
- Test infrastructure mostly updated but needs completion
- No dynamic loading functions remain in production code
- Parser constructor signature changed: `new EnglishParser(languageProvider, { world })`
- Story.setStory() is no longer async
- Language configuration removed from StoryConfig

## Command Line Syntax Issue
User noted repeated syntax error with "2>&1" being misinterpreted in command execution. Need to be careful with shell redirection syntax in future sessions.
