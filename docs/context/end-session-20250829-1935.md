# Work Session Summary - Taking Action Refactor Deep Dive

## Date: 2025-08-29
## Session Duration: ~2 hours
## Focus: Taking action refactoring and event system architecture

---

## Work Completed

### 1. Comprehensive Taking Action Analysis
- **Created detailed refactoring framework** with templates for:
  - Master refactoring plan (problems, solutions, anti-patterns)
  - Action-specific checklists (6-phase process)
  - Pre-refactor design specifications
  - Post-refactor review templates
  - Signoff documentation
- **Key Decision**: No more "lawnmower refactoring" - complete one action fully before moving to next

### 2. Taking Action Specific Analysis
- **Phase 1 Completed**: Full analysis of current implementation
- **Problems Identified**:
  - Context pollution (`_previousLocation`, `_implicitlyRemoved`)
  - Direct world mutation instead of behavior usage
  - Missing visibility/container checks (actually handled by scope!)
  - Complex validation logic
- **Phase 2 Completed**: Design specification with scenarios

### 3. Scenario-Driven Design
- **Added scenarios to design process** - validate design through real use cases
- **Documented 15+ scenarios** for taking action with expected events
- **Key Insight**: Scope system already handles visibility/container access via `ScopeLevel.REACHABLE`

### 4. Event System Research
- **Researched removal patterns** across three related actions:
  - `take X` → taking action (pick up from anywhere)
  - `remove X from Y` → removing action (explicit container source)
  - `remove X` / `take off X` → taking_off action (worn items)
- **Found widespread context pollution** in multiple actions
- **Identified event confusion**: Both taking and removing emit `if.event.taken`

### 5. Architectural Decision Record (ADR-064)
- **Created ADR for two-layer event system**:
  - World Events: Low-level, factual state changes
  - Action Events: High-level, semantic player intent
- **Proposed solution**: `world.moveEntity()` returns `MoveResult` with context
- **Benefits**: Rich events without context pollution

### 6. Practical Event Flow Example
- **Worked through complex scenario**: locked box → unlock → open → take ball → put in satchel
- **Documented complete event flow** showing:
  - World events (state changes)
  - Action events (semantic meaning)
  - Text service message construction
- **Validated** that rich events enable rich narrative text

## Key Insights

### 1. No PortableTrait Needed
- Objects are takeable by default (IF convention)
- SceneryTrait marks fixed items
- Simpler than creating new trait

### 2. Scope System Does Heavy Lifting
- Already checks visibility
- Already checks container accessibility (open/closed)
- Already handles locked containers (locked implies closed)
- Taking action doesn't need these checks

### 3. Context Pollution is Widespread
- Not just taking action - removing, dropping, others have same problem
- Current pattern of storing on context object is an anti-pattern
- Need systematic solution

### 4. Events Need Rich Context
- Authors need detailed events to make decisions
- "Taken." vs "You take the ball from the box." - context matters
- Sharpee should provide maximum information, let stories decide

### 5. World Model as Source of Truth
- World knows where things are and where they moved from
- Should be able to provide movement context
- Behaviors mutate state, world tracks changes

---

## Decisions Made

### 1. Event System Architecture
- Two-layer system: world events (factual) + action events (semantic)
- World mutations should return rich results
- Actions use these results to build semantic events

### 2. Taking Action Approach
- Remove all context pollution
- Use world.moveEntity() return value for context
- Emit rich events with full information
- Let text service use what it needs

### 3. Process Improvements
- One action at a time, fully complete
- Scenarios drive design validation
- Document everything (specs, reviews, signoffs)
- No shortcuts or batch changes

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 3)
1. Implement ADR-064 pattern for world.moveEntity()
2. Update taking action to use new pattern
3. Remove context pollution
4. Test with scenarios

### Follow-up
1. Update other actions with same pattern
2. Consider world events for other mutations
3. Update witness system to use world events
4. Document patterns for future actions

---

## Questions Resolved

1. **Q**: How to track where items came from?
   **A**: World.moveEntity() should return movement context

2. **Q**: Should we emit if.event.removed for worn items?
   **A**: Yes, actions emit all semantic events (behaviors don't emit)

3. **Q**: Visibility and container checks?
   **A**: Scope system already handles via ScopeLevel.REACHABLE

4. **Q**: Simple "Taken." or rich "Taken from X"?
   **A**: Provide rich events, let text service/stories decide

---

## Questions Remaining

1. Should execute() method signature change to return data?
2. How to handle backward compatibility for existing actions?
3. Should all world mutations emit events or just movement?
4. Event naming conventions for world vs action events?

## Session Summary

Productive session that went deep on the taking action refactor but uncovered systemic issues with context pollution and event richness across the codebase. Rather than just fixing taking, we've designed a comprehensive solution (ADR-064) that will improve all actions. The scenario-driven approach proved valuable for validating design decisions. Ready to implement Phase 3 with clear direction.
