## Major Achievement: Entity Event Handlers Working! ðŸŽ‰

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Implemented Entity Event Handlers (ADR-052)**
   - Added entity event handler processing to CommandExecutor
   - Entity.on handlers now properly fire when events are emitted
   - Successfully tested with Cloak of Darkness story
   - Hook's event handler detects when cloak is hung and turns on lights in bar

2. **Fixed Cloak of Darkness Story**
   - Fixed event handler to use correct entity IDs (i01 for cloak, s01 for hook)
   - Bar room now properly lights up when cloak is hung on hook
   - Player can successfully navigate to the bar after hanging cloak
   - Message in sawdust is now visible and examinable

3. **Created Standard READ Action**
   - Implemented reading action in stdlib/src/actions/standard/reading/
   - Works with existing ReadableTrait from world-model
   - Supports multiple readable types (books, signs, inscriptions, notes)
   - Handles multi-page books with current page tracking
   - Added verb mappings and language templates
   - Created comprehensive tests (needs minor fixes)

### Technical Details

#### Entity Event Handler Implementation
```typescript
// In CommandExecutor.processEntityHandlers()
- Checks all entities for .on property
- Converts SemanticEvent to GameEvent format
- Calls matching handlers by event type
- Collects returned events and processes them
```

#### Event Flow
1. Action emits event (e.g., IF.EVENT.PUT_ON)
2. CommandExecutor processes entity handlers BEFORE world updates
3. Entity handlers can return new events
4. All events are processed by EventProcessor

### Current State

#### Working
- âœ… Entity event handlers firing correctly
- âœ… Cloak of Darkness playable up to reading message
- âœ… Lights turn on when cloak is hung
- âœ… READ action implemented and integrated

#### Needs Work
- Reading action tests need minor import fixes
- "read message" command not yet working in Cloak of Darkness (needs parser mapping)
- Some TypeScript type issues resolved with String() casts

### Test Results
- Cloak of Darkness manual test successful:
  - Can hang cloak on hook
  - Lights turn on (console log confirms)
  - Can go south to bar
  - Can examine message
  - Only "read message" not working (parser issue)

### Next Steps
1. Fix reading test imports to use correct test utilities
2. Add READ verb to Cloak of Darkness parser mappings
3. Complete full playthrough test
4. Consider implementing custom HANG action for better semantics

### Files Modified
- `/packages/engine/src/command-executor.ts` - Added processEntityHandlers method
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/reading/` - New reading action
- `/packages/lang-en-us/src/data/verbs.ts` - Added READ verb mapping
- `/packages/lang-en-us/src/data/templates.ts` - Added reading messages
- `/stories/cloak-of-darkness/src/index.ts` - Fixed event handler logic

### Architectural Impact
This session successfully proved that the ADR-052 event handler pattern works as designed. Entities can now respond to events, enabling complex game logic without coupling actions to specific game mechanics. This is a major milestone for the Sharpee engine's flexibility and extensibility.
