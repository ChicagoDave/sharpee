# Session Summary: 2026-02-18 - main

## Status: Completed

## Goals
- Review and update ADR-100 (Screen Reader Client) with current state and implementation plan
- Fix mobile navigation bar on the Sharpee website

## Completed

### ADR-100 Accessibility Update
- Reviewed ADR-100 (Screen Reader Client), which was in IDENTIFIED status with 5 open questions
- Audited the Zifmia React client (`clients/zifmia/`) and `packages/platform-browser/` for existing ARIA support
- Found critical gaps: no live regions on transcript output, no label on command input, no status line ARIA, no menu bar roles, no semantic HTML5 layout
- Updated ADR-100 status from IDENTIFIED to ACCEPTED
- Documented current state of ARIA coverage in the ADR
- Wrote a 3-tier implementation plan:
  - Tier 1 (core game loop): transcript live region (`aria-live="polite"`), input label, status line ARIA
  - Tier 2 (layout): semantic HTML5 layout (`<main>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`), dialog focus traps, menu ARIA roles
  - Tier 3 (polish): announcement service for scored events, skip links, high contrast/reduced motion support
- Answered all 5 previously-open questions in the ADR
- Committed as `ff6c3c7`

### Website Mobile Nav Fix
- Identified that `website/src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` had no responsive styles for the nav bar
- Nav links were overflowing horizontally on small screens
- Added `flex-wrap: wrap` to `.nav-inner` so links wrap to additional lines instead of overflowing
- Added `@media (max-width: 480px)` query reducing logo size, title font size, nav link padding/font-size, and main content padding on small phones

## Key Decisions

### 1. No Separate Screen Reader Mode
The standard Zifmia client should be accessible by default — no toggle or separate build. ARIA attributes are additive and do not affect sighted users. This avoids the maintenance burden of two parallel code paths.

### 2. Flex-Wrap Instead of Hamburger Menu
With only 6 nav links, a hamburger menu adds JavaScript complexity for no real gain. `flex-wrap: wrap` on `.nav-inner` solves the overflow problem cleanly with pure CSS and remains keyboard/screen reader friendly.

### 3. Real User Testing Required Before Implementation
The ADR notes that Tier 1 ARIA changes should be tested with actual screen reader users (NVDA + Firefox, VoiceOver + Safari) before wider rollout, not just automated axe-core audits.

## Open Items

### Short Term
- Implement Tier 1 ARIA changes in Zifmia React client (transcript live region, input label, status line)
- Test mobile nav fix across real devices at various breakpoints

### Long Term
- Tier 2: semantic HTML5 layout, dialog focus traps, menu ARIA roles
- Tier 3: announcement service, skip links, high contrast/reduced motion support
- Recruit screen reader users for testing before shipping ARIA changes

## Files Modified

**Documentation** (1 file):
- `docs/architecture/adrs/adr-100-screen-reader-client.md` - Full rewrite: status IDENTIFIED -> ACCEPTED, current state audit, 3-tier implementation plan, all open questions answered

**Website** (1 file):
- `website/src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` - Added `flex-wrap: wrap` to `.nav-inner`, added `@media (max-width: 480px)` responsive styles for logo, title, nav links, and main content padding

## Architectural Notes

The accessibility audit revealed that the Zifmia client's transcript container currently has no `aria-live` region, meaning screen readers receive no automatic announcements when the game outputs text. This is the single highest-impact fix. The `aria-live="polite"` attribute on the transcript container will allow screen readers to announce new output at the next pause in speech without interrupting ongoing narration.

The ADR-100 3-tier plan is sequenced so Tier 1 alone makes the game playable for screen reader users. Tiers 2 and 3 improve the experience but are not blockers for basic accessibility.

## Notes

**Session duration**: ~1 hour

**Approach**: Audit-first — reviewed existing code before writing the plan, ensuring the ADR reflects actual gaps rather than hypothetical ones.
