# Session Summary: Action Design Professional Reviews (Batch 2)
**Date**: 2025-08-26
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Focus**: Professional development reviews of stdlib action designs (actions 6-10)

## Work Completed

### Action Design Reviews Created
Completed comprehensive professional reviews for actions 6-10 from `docs/actions-list.txt`:

1. **drinking-review.md** - Score: 4/10
   - State reconstruction anti-pattern
   - Missing three-phase pattern
   - 286 lines of monolithic code
   - Type safety violations throughout
   - Needs complete rewrite

2. **dropping-review.md** - Score: 8.5/10
   - Near excellence with proper patterns
   - Clean three-phase implementation
   - Good behavior delegation
   - Minor context storage issue only
   - Should be used as template (with fix)

3. **eating-review.md** - Score: 3.5/10
   - CRITICAL: 85% code duplication with drinking
   - Copy-paste anti-pattern at scale
   - Same flaws as drinking plus DRY violation
   - Needs shared ConsumptionBehavior abstraction
   - Worst score so far due to duplication

4. **entering-review.md** - Score: 6/10
   - Good validation logic
   - Missing report() phase entirely
   - Direct state mutations bypassing behaviors
   - Execute() returning events (wrong)
   - Fixable with moderate refactoring

5. **examining-review.md** - Score: 9/10
   - Exemplary read-only action
   - Perfect three-phase for observation
   - Empty execute() (correct for read-only)
   - Data builders properly used
   - Template quality for all read-only actions

## Key Findings

### Critical Anti-Patterns Discovered

#### Code Duplication Crisis (Eating/Drinking)
```typescript
// Both actions share ~85% identical code
// Only difference is checking isDrink flag
(edibleTrait as any).isDrink  // Line 71 in eating, 67 in drinking
```
- Violates DRY principle severely
- Doubles maintenance burden
- Bugs must be fixed twice
- Indicates review process failure

#### State Reconstruction Spreading
Found in multiple actions:
- Drinking (line 114)
- Eating (line 93)
- Pattern spreading through codebase

### Excellence Patterns Confirmed

#### Read-Only Action Pattern (Examining)
```typescript
validate(): ValidationResult { /* check only */ }
execute(): void { /* empty - no mutations */ }
report(): ISemanticEvent[] { /* all events */ }
```

#### Proper Three-Phase (Dropping)
- Clean separation of concerns
- Behavior delegation
- Trust in validation

## Quality Distribution

### Score Breakdown (All 10 Actions)
- **9-10/10**: 3 actions (About, Closing, Examining)
- **8-9/10**: 1 action (Dropping)
- **6-7/10**: 2 actions (Again, Entering)
- **3-4/10**: 3 actions (Attacking, Eating, Drinking)
- **Average**: 6.35/10 (slightly lower than batch 1)

### Templates Identified
1. **Meta-Actions**: About (9.5/10)
2. **State-Changing**: Closing (9/10)
3. **Read-Only**: Examining (9/10)
4. **Object Manipulation**: Dropping (8.5/10 with fix)

## Urgent Recommendations

### Priority 1: Consumption Actions Rewrite
**Eating & Drinking** need immediate shared abstraction:
```typescript
abstract class ConsumptionBehavior {
  static consume(item: IEntity, type: 'eat' | 'drink'): ConsumptionResult
  static checkConsumable(item: IEntity, type: 'eat' | 'drink'): boolean
  static getEffects(item: IEntity): EffectData
}
```
**Estimated**: 26 hours for both actions

### Priority 2: Pattern Enforcement
1. Add linter rules for three-phase pattern
2. Detect code duplication in reviews
3. Enforce behavior delegation
4. Block direct state mutations

### Priority 3: Documentation
1. Document Examining as read-only template
2. Document Dropping as manipulation template
3. Create anti-pattern examples from eating/drinking

## Statistics Update

- **Actions Reviewed**: 10 of 48 (20.8%)
- **Template Quality**: 4 (About, Closing, Examining, Dropping*)
- **Needs Refactoring**: 2 (Again, Entering)
- **Needs Complete Rewrite**: 4 (Attacking, Drinking, Eating, Climbing)
- **Average Score**: 6.35/10
- **Score Range**: 3.5/10 to 9.5/10

## Architectural Insights

### Pattern Adoption Varies Wildly
- Some actions (Examining) perfectly follow patterns
- Others (Eating/Drinking) violate every principle
- No middle ground - actions are either excellent or poor

### Copy-Paste Problem Severe
- Eating/Drinking share 85% code
- Likely other pairs exist (taking/dropping?, opening/closing?)
- Need systematic duplication analysis

### Read-Only Actions Excel
- Both About and Examining score 9+
- Pattern is clear and easy to follow
- Should standardize for all observation actions

## Next Steps
1. Continue reviewing remaining 38 actions
2. Flag any more code duplication immediately
3. Create shared abstractions before more copies spread
4. Use templates for training and reviews

## Session Notes
- Code duplication is worse than expected
- Quality variance remains extreme (3.5 to 9.5)
- Templates are emerging clearly
- Urgent need for consumption abstraction
- Pattern enforcement must be automated
