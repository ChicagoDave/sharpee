# Session Summary - August 22, 2025 01:04

## Session Overview
Continued Phase 2 of the atomic events refactor, focusing on action architecture redesign and rules system for story logic. Made critical architectural decisions about separating action phases and adding author-customizable rules.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Phase 1 Cleanup
- Marked Phase 1 as complete in checklist
- Removed event builder classes (decided against that abstraction)
- Fixed remaining `payload` to `data` migration issues
- All tests passing except one minor issue with looking action

### 2. Architectural Analysis
- Deep assessment of current Action interface vs proposed three-phase pattern
- Identified problems with current mixed responsibilities in `execute()`
- Proposed clean separation: validate/execute/report

### 3. Rules System Design (ADR-057)
- Designed before/after rules system for story logic injection
- Rules are first-class objects with:
  - `when`: condition function
  - `run`: effect function  
  - `order`: explicit execution ordering
- Rules can mutate state before validation
- Enables author customization without modifying core actions

### 4. Report Function Design (ADR-058)
- Separated event generation from action execution
- Three-phase pattern:
  1. `validate()`: Can this happen?
  2. `execute()`: Make it happen (mutations)
  3. `report()`: What happened? (event generation)
- Report captures complete state AFTER all mutations
- Ensures atomic events with all necessary data

## Technical Details

### Current vs Proposed Architecture

**Current (Mixed Responsibilities):**
```typescript
interface Action {
  validate(context): ValidationResult;
  execute(context): ISemanticEvent[];  // Does BOTH mutations and events
}
```

**Proposed (Clean Separation):**
```typescript
interface Action {
  validate(context): ValidationResult;  // Can we?
  execute(context): void;               // Do it
  report(context): ISemanticEvent[];    // What happened?
}
```

### Complete Execution Flow
1. **Before Rules** - Prepare state, can prevent
2. **Action.validate()** - Sees prepared state
3. **Action.execute()** - Mutations only
4. **After Rules** - React to action
5. **Action.report()** - Generate atomic events from final state

### Rules Example
```typescript
const rule = {
  id: 'auto-wear-gloves',
  order: 10,
  when: (ctx) => 
    ctx.phase === 'before' && 
    ctx.action === 'taking' &&
    ctx.target?.id === 'fragile-vase',
  run: (ctx) => {
    if (!ctx.player.isWearing('gloves') && ctx.player.has('gloves')) {
      ctx.world.wearItem(ctx.player.id, 'gloves');
      return { events: [/* auto-equipped message */] };
    }
  }
};
```

## Key Decisions

1. **No event builders** - Direct event creation is simpler and sufficient
2. **Rules before validation** - Rules can prepare state that validation sees
3. **`when`/`run` naming** - Avoids reserved keywords (`if`/`do`)
4. **Report after all mutations** - Ensures complete state capture
5. **Rules can mutate state** - Necessary for prep actions like auto-equip

- `/docs/architecture/adrs/adr-058-action-report-function.md` - Report function design

### Modified
- `/docs/work/atomic-events-checklist.md` - Updated for new approach
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/looking/looking.ts` - Started atomic event migration
- `/packages/stdlib/src/scope/types.ts` - Changed `payload` to `data`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/scope/witness-system.ts` - Updated event structure
- `/packages/stdlib/src/query-handlers/quit-handler.ts` - Fixed event structure

## Next Steps

1. **Implement proof-of-concept** with looking action using new three-phase pattern
2. **Update CommandExecutor** to support validate/execute/report with rules
3. **Migrate high-impact actions** (taking, going, examining)
4. **Create rule system implementation** with proper ordering and context
5. **Test with Cloak of Darkness** story to ensure everything works

## Insights

### Architecture Clarity
The three-phase pattern provides much clearer separation of concerns. Each phase has a single responsibility, making the system easier to understand, test, and extend.

### Rules vs Validation
Having rules run BEFORE validation is crucial - they're not just validation rules, they're preparation rules that can set up the world state for the action to succeed.

### Atomic Events Progress
With the report phase separate, we can finally guarantee that events contain complete snapshots of state at the moment they were created, enabling true historical replay.

### Author Experience
The rules system gives authors powerful customization without needing to modify core action code. The `when`/`run` pattern is intuitive and avoids complex middleware chains.

## Proposed Advanced Features

### Rule Groups
For better organization and management of complex story logic, rules could be organized into named groups (similar to Inform's rulebooks):

```typescript
// Rule groups for organization
interface RuleGroup {
  id: string;
  enabled?: boolean | (() => boolean);
  rules: Rule[];
}

const story = {
  ruleGroups: [
    {
      id: 'tutorial',
      enabled: () => !world.getFlag('tutorial-complete'),
      rules: [/* tutorial-specific rules */]
    },
    {
      id: 'endgame',
      enabled: () => world.getFlag('act-3-started'),
      rules: [/* endgame-specific rules */]
    }
  ]
};
```

This would allow:
- Conditional enabling/disabling of entire rule sets
- Better organization of story-specific logic
- Named references to rule groups
- Cleaner separation of different story phases or modes

## Session Impact
This session established the architectural foundation for completing the atomic events refactor. The three-phase action pattern and rules system provide the structure needed for both atomic events and author customization. Ready to implement and test these patterns.
