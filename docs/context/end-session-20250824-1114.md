# Session Summary - August 24, 2025, 11:14

## Session Overview
Merged the atomic events refactor branch from GitHub, resolved merge conflicts, and began fixing test failures related to the new three-phase action pattern (validate/execute/report).

## Key Issues Addressed

### Issue 1: Cloak of Darkness "too_dark" Error Not Displaying
**Problem**: When trying to move south in the Foyer (turn 7), the game showed an ACTION.ERROR event but no error message was displayed to the player.

**Root Cause**: The CLIEventsTextService wasn't handling `action.error` events properly - it was just showing raw JSON instead of translating error messages.

**Solution**: Enhanced CLIEventsTextService to:
- Check for `action.error` events and use the language provider to get translated messages
- Try both action-specific messages (`if.action.going.too_dark`) and generic messages (`too_dark`)
- Show system events when trace/debug is enabled

### Issue 2: Git Merge Conflicts After Pull
**Problem**: After merging the atomic events refactor PR from GitHub, there were merge conflicts in `packages/text-services/src/cli-events-text-service.ts`

**Solution**: Resolved conflicts by keeping the enhanced version with action.error handling and fixing TypeScript compilation issues.

### Issue 3: Test Failures in Going Action
**Problem**: The going action's three-phase pattern tests were failing because the `toRoom` field in events was showing the wrong room ID.

**Root Cause**: The action's data builders were using `context.currentLocation` which was cached when the context was created, not updated after the `execute()` phase moved the player.

**Solution**: Modified the going action's data builders to query the actual current location from the world model:
```typescript
// Instead of using cached context.currentLocation
const currentLocationId = context.world.getLocation(actor.id);
const currentRoom = context.world.getEntity(currentLocationId!)!;
```

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. **packages/text-services/src/cli-events-text-service.ts**
   - Added special handling for `action.error` events
   - Added system event display when debug is enabled
   - Fixed TypeScript issues after merge

2. **packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/going/going-data.ts**
   - Fixed `buildActorMovedData` to get fresh location after movement
   - Fixed `buildActorExitedData` to use actual current location
   - Fixed `buildActorEnteredData` to use actual current location

### Merged Code from Atomic Events Refactor
The PR brought in significant changes:
- **Three-phase action pattern**: validate → execute → report
- **Report function**: All actions now have a `report()` method for event generation
- **Event enrichment**: Moved to the report phase with entity snapshots
- **Event adapter enhancements**: Added normalization, migration, and enrichment pipelines
- **Command executor refactor**: Simplified to ~100 lines, delegating to components

## Outstanding Issues

### Test Failures Still to Fix
1. **Scope validation tests** - CARRIED scope validation failing with assertion errors
2. **Container visibility tests** - parseCommand function not found errors
3. **Action parameter tests** - Tests expecting simple params but getting entity snapshots
4. **Other golden pattern tests** - Similar issues with closing, dropping, opening actions

### Architecture Observations
- The three-phase pattern (validate/execute/report) is now properly implemented in the going action
- The report function is responsible for ALL event generation including error events
- Context caching issue: ActionContext caches values like `currentLocation` at creation time, which can become stale after mutations in execute()

## Next Steps
1. Continue fixing test failures in other actions
2. Update all action tests to expect entity snapshots in error params
3. Consider whether ActionContext should provide dynamic getters instead of cached values
4. Add report function to Action interface as a required method
5. Implement report function in all remaining actions

## Commits Created
- **1ab9b20**: `fix: Improve CLIEventsTextService to handle action.error messages and show system events`
- Successfully rebased after merge conflicts

## Status
- Branch: main (merged with atomic events refactor)
- Partial test fixes applied
- Build successful but tests still failing
- Ready to continue fixing remaining test issues
