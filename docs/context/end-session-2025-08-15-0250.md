# Session Summary - 2025-08-15 02:50

## Overview
Fixed victory detection in Cloak of Darkness, then shifted focus to designing and implementing a systemic blood magic extension for the Reflections story. Established extension architecture patterns for the Sharpee platform.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Victory Detection ✅
- **Issue**: End game events weren't firing when player read the winning message
- **Root Cause**: Story's event handler was listening for `action.read.success` but the reading action emits `if.event.read`
- **Fix**: Changed event handler in Cloak of Darkness to listen for correct event
- **Result**: Victory detection now works, proper event chain fires:
  - `if.event.read` → `story.victory` → `game.ending` → `game.won` → `game.ended`

### 2. Designed Blood Magic System ✅
Explored implementing the Reflections story, leading to systematic design of blood magic:

#### Design Process
- Created iterative design documents (design-001.md, discussion-001.md, etc.)
- Refined mechanics through discussion
- Decided on systemic rules-based approach vs ad-hoc implementation

#### Blood Types Defined
1. **Blood of Silver** - Mirror portal creation and travel
2. **Blood of Moon** - Invisibility at will
3. **Blood of Earth** - Preservation/resurrection (narrative only)
4. **Blood of Stars** - Foresight/seeing other blood users (NPC only)

#### Key Design Decisions
- Blood abilities are "always available like breathing" - fail gracefully if lacking
- Mirror connections are permanent until broken
- Physical constraints matter (covered mirrors, face-down, orientation)
- No magical backlash - abilities are "mundane muscle memory"
- Signatures fade over time (story hours, not real time)

### 3. Established Extension Architecture Pattern ✅
Defined how extensions should be structured in Sharpee:

```
extension-name/
├── src/
│   ├── actions/      # New verbs/commands
│   ├── traits/       # Entity properties
│   ├── behaviors/    # Complex logic
│   ├── events/       # Event definitions
│   ├── grammar/      # Parser patterns
│   ├── rules/        # System rules
│   ├── messages/     # Response templates
│   └── index.ts      # Main export
├── tests/
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

### 4. Implemented Blood Magic Extension Structure ✅

#### Created Core Components
- **MirrorTrait** - Tracks orientation, connections, signatures, state
- **BloodSilverTrait** - Mirror user abilities and tracking
- **BloodMoonTrait** - Invisibility state and tracking
- **Blood Events** - Complete event system for mirror/moon interactions
- **Mirror Actions** - TOUCH, CONNECT, ENTER, LOOK THROUGH implementations

#### Mirror Mechanics Implemented
- **Orientation-based entry**: wall (enter), floor (step on), ceiling (fall through)
- **State constraints**: covered (exit only), face-down (no travel), broken (no use)
- **Connection system**: bidirectional links, established by Silver carriers
- **Signature tracking**: who used mirrors and when
- **Sensing ripples**: Silver carriers detect others using their connected mirrors

## Technical Decisions

### Extension vs Story Code
- Extensions provide systemic mechanics (blood magic rules)
- Stories use extensions for their narrative (Reflections uses blood-magic)
- Traits over Capabilities for entity-specific properties
- Capabilities for world-level state when needed

### Mirror Portal Design
- Physical touch required for all mirror interactions
- Connections stored as metadata in MirrorTrait
- Quality affects LOOK/LISTEN clarity
- Size doesn't restrict travel (even phone mirrors work)
- Handheld mirrors allow carrying objects through

## Files Created/Modified

### Fixed
- `/stories/cloak-of-darkness/src/index.ts` - Fixed event handler

### New Extension
- `/packages/extensions/blood-magic/`
  - `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`
  - `design-001.md`, `discussion-001.md`, `discussion-002.md`, `discussion-003.md`
  - `/src/traits/` - mirror-trait.ts, blood-silver-trait.ts, blood-moon-trait.ts
  - `/src/events/` - blood-events.ts
  - `/src/actions/` - mirror-actions.ts
  - `/src/index.ts` - Main extension export

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Complete remaining mirror actions (STEP ON, FALL THROUGH variants)
2. Implement moon blood actions (TOUCH MOON, FORGET MOON)
3. Create behavior modules for complex travel logic
4. Add grammar patterns for special commands

### Medium Term
1. Write comprehensive tests for mirror mechanics
2. Implement invisibility scope modifications
3. Create message templates for all responses
4. Build registration system for extensions

### Long Term
1. Implement Reflections story using blood-magic extension
2. Character switching mechanics
3. Multiple endings system
4. Story-time tracking for signatures

## Key Insights

1. **Systemic Design**: Building reusable extensions makes stories more maintainable
2. **Physical Grounding**: Mirror mechanics feel realistic with physical constraints
3. **Narrative vs Mechanical**: Some blood types (Earth, Stars) are narrative-only, which is fine
4. **Extension Pattern**: Clear structure helps organize complex mechanics

## Session End State
