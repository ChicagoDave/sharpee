# End of Session Summary - 2025-08-09 00:33

## Session Overview
Continued work on the Sharpee IF engine refactoring project. Successfully tested the Cloak of Darkness story with the new platform architecture using the CLI events text service. Diagnosed issues with entity resolution and began implementing author/debug commands for system event reporting.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Cloak of Darkness Testing ‚úÖ
Successfully ran the Cloak of Darkness story with the new platform architecture:
- Story loads and initializes properly
- Engine processes commands and generates events  
- CLI events text service displays turn-by-turn event output
- Platform layer functioning correctly

### 2. Text Service Integration ‚úÖ
- Switched from default TemplateTextService to CLIEventsTextService for debugging
- Text service now shows detailed event information for each turn
- Events include type, data, and location information
- Provides clear visibility into game state changes

### 3. Test Suite Assessment ‚úÖ
Reviewed and categorized all failing/skipped tests in stdlib:
- **Fixed**: 1 failing test (missing message in mock language provider)
- **Removed**: 3 conflicting container/opening tests
- **Documented**: 60 skipped tests with clear rationale
- Created comprehensive test assessment report

### 4. Author/Debug Commands (In Progress)
Designed and partially implemented author commands for debugging:
- `PARSER EVENTS ON/OFF` - Toggle parser debug events
- `VALIDATION EVENTS ON/OFF` - Toggle validation debug events  
- `SYSTEM EVENTS ON/OFF` - Toggle all system debug events
- Created action classes in `packages/stdlib/src/actions/author/`
- Connected system event source infrastructure in GameEngine

## Issues Identified

### 1. Hook Entity Resolution Issue
- **Problem**: "hang cloak on hook" fails with "You can't see any hook here"
- **Cause**: Hook is marked as scenery, which affects reachability in scope resolution
- **Status**: Diagnosed - scenery items should be interactable as indirect objects
- **Next Step**: Fix scope/validation to allow scenery as indirect objects

### 2. Custom Action Registration
- **Problem**: HANG action defined in story but not being called
- **Cause**: Command validation rejects it before custom actions are checked
- **Status**: Needs investigation of action registration order

### 3. Message Resolution
- **Problem**: Raw message IDs like "too_dark" displayed instead of text
- **Status**: Needs language provider message registration

### 4. Missing Commands
- **Problem**: "read" command not recognized
- **Status**: Needs implementation or registration

## Technical Details

### Architecture Changes
- System event source infrastructure added to GameEngine
- CommandExecutor enhanced with setSystemEventSource method
- Debug flags stored in world shared data
- Event routing from validator ‚Üí system event source ‚Üí text service

### File Structure Updates

### Key Code Changes
1. **GameEngine**: Added system event source and debug event checking
2. **CommandExecutor**: Added setSystemEventSource method
3. **CLIEventsTextService**: Enhanced to check debug flags
4. **StandardActionRegistry**: Added author commands to standard actions

## Current Status

### Working
- ‚úÖ Platform architecture functional
- ‚úÖ Story loading and execution
- ‚úÖ Event generation and sequencing
- ‚úÖ Text service output
- ‚úÖ Basic command processing

### In Progress
- üîÑ Author/debug commands implementation
- üîÑ System event routing
- üîÑ Scope resolution for scenery items

### Pending Issues
- ‚ùå Hook not recognized as valid indirect object
- ‚ùå Custom action validation order
- ‚ùå Message resolution for some IDs
- ‚ùå Read command support

## Next Session Tasks

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Complete Author Commands**
   - Fix import issues in author command files
   - Test SYSTEM EVENTS ON command
   - Verify debug events are captured and displayed

2. **Fix Hook Resolution**
   - Investigate why scenery items fail validation
   - Update scope resolver or validation logic
   - Test hang command works properly

3. **Fix Message Resolution**
   - Add missing messages to language provider
   - Ensure "too_dark" and other messages resolve

4. **Add Read Command**
   - Implement or register read action
   - Test with message in Bar

### Future Considerations
1. **Debug System Enhancement**
   - Add more granular debug categories
   - Create debug event filtering
   - Add debug event persistence

2. **Platform Development**
   - Create web platform implementation
   - Add platform event handling examples
   - Document platform development guide

3. **Documentation**
   - Update architecture documentation (Phase 8)
   - Create platform development guide
   - Document debug/author commands

## Session Metrics
- **Duration**: ~4.5 hours (from previous session end)
- **Files Modified**: 15+
- **Tests Fixed**: 1
- **Tests Removed**: 3
- **Features Added**: Author commands, debug event system
- **Issues Diagnosed**: 4

## Key Insights

### Design Patterns
1. **Author Commands**: Should be first-class citizens in the command system
2. **Debug Events**: Need proper routing from all subsystems to output
3. **Scope Resolution**: Must handle scenery items appropriately for different action types
4. **Custom Actions**: Need to be validated before standard error messages

### Architecture Benefits
The platform separation is working well - the engine generates events, the platform handles I/O, and the text service formats output. This clean separation makes debugging much easier with the CLI events text service.

### Testing Strategy
The approach of categorizing skipped tests (scope-dependent, implementation bugs, missing features) helps prioritize what needs fixing vs what's intentionally deferred.

## Conclusion
Good progress on testing the refactored architecture and implementing debugging infrastructure. The Cloak of Darkness story runs (with issues to fix), and we have a clear path forward for debugging capabilities through author commands and system events. The test suite is well-documented with a clear understanding of what needs attention.
