# Session Summary - August 22, 2025 17:44

## Session Overview
Refined and simplified the architectural decisions for action customization and rules system. Made critical improvements to ADR-057, ADR-058, and ADR-059 based on practical considerations and developer experience.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Updated Work Plans with ADRs
- Integrated ADR-057 (Rules System) and ADR-058 (Three-phase pattern) into refactor plans
- Restructured phases to implement architecture changes before action migrations
- Updated checklist with detailed implementation steps for each phase

### 2. Simplified ADR-059 (Action Customization)
- **Removed over-engineering**: Eliminated complex DataSource/DataTransform enums
- **Simple data builders**: Each action has a `buildXData()` function
- **Story extensions**: Simple functions that extend base data
- **Protected core fields**: Essential data (actionId, success, actor) protected from corruption

**Final approach:**
```typescript
// In action's data file
export function buildTakingData(context, preState, postState) {
  return {
    actionId: 'taking',
    success: context.result.success,
    item: captureEntitySnapshot(item),
    // ... more data
  };
}

// Story can extend
dataExtensions: {
  'taking': (baseData, context, preState, postState) => {
    return { ...baseData, customField: 'custom value' };
  }
}
```

### 3. Refined Rules System (ADR-057)
- **Concrete Rule classes**: No abstract classes, just `new BeforeRule({...})` and `new AfterRule({...})`
- **Explicit type field**: Rules have `type: 'before' | 'after'` instead of checking phase in condition
- **Co-location with entities**: Rules can be attached to entities/rooms, not just global story array

**Better developer experience:**
```typescript
const vase = world.createEntity({...});
vase.addRule(new BeforeRule({
  id: 'require-gloves',
  when: (ctx) => ctx.action === 'taking',
  run: (ctx) => { /* check for gloves */ }
}));
```

### 4. Key Architectural Decisions

#### Rule Organization
- Rules can be defined at multiple levels:
  - **Entity rules**: Attached to specific objects
  - **Room rules**: Attached to locations  
  - **Story rules**: Global cross-cutting concerns
- Rules gathered from all sources during execution
- Co-location prevents orphaned rules and improves discoverability

#### Data Configuration
- Each action has a data builder function (not declarative config)
- Stories extend data with simple functions
- Core fields protected from modification
- No complex transformation pipelines

## Technical Insights

### Simplification Benefits
Removing over-engineered abstractions made the system:
- Easier to understand (just functions and classes)
- More testable (pure functions for data building)
- More maintainable (co-located rules with entities)
- More flexible (simple extension functions)

### Developer Experience Focus
Key improvements for authors:
- Rules live with what they affect (like Inform 7)
- Simple class instantiation patterns
- No complex configuration schemas
- Clear separation of concerns

## Next Steps

1. **Finalize entity creation patterns** - Determine actual patterns used in Sharpee for entity/room creation
2. **Implement Phase 2** - Action Architecture Redesign
   - Update Action interface
   - Update CommandExecutor
   - Create migration utilities
3. **Implement Phase 3** - Rules System
   - Define Rule interfaces
   - Build rule engine
   - Integrate with CommandExecutor
4. **Begin Phase 4** - Migrate looking.ts as proof of concept

## Open Questions

1. **Entity creation syntax**: How are entities actually created in Sharpee stories?
2. **Rule attachment**: Should rules be added via `addRule()` method or configuration?
3. **Rule precedence**: Should entity rules override room rules? Or by order only?
4. **Data protection**: How strictly should core fields be protected?

## Session Impact
This session significantly simplified the architecture while maintaining flexibility. The focus on developer experience and co-location of related code will make the system more maintainable and intuitive for story authors. Ready to begin implementation of the simplified design.
