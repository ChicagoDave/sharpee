# Session Summary - August 18, 2025 20:34

## Session Overview
Successfully fixed all remaining semantic parsing test failures in the parser-en-us package by implementing proper semantic building in the grammar engine and resolving pattern matching priority issues.

## Starting Context
- Session began with 3 failing semantic parsing tests from previous session
- Previous session had reduced failures from 10 to 3
- Main issues were with semantic properties not being applied correctly

## Problems Identified

### 1. Missing Semantic Properties
- Tests for "go north" and "run east" were missing `manner` property
- Tests for "discard wrapper" were getting `manner: 'normal'` instead of `'careless'`
- Insert rules were missing `manner` property entirely

### 2. Duplicate Semantic Building
- Both `EnglishGrammarEngine` and `SemanticParserEngine` were trying to build semantics
- `SemanticParserEngine` was overriding semantics already built by base engine

### 3. Pattern Matching Priority Issues
- Multiple rules matching the same input (e.g., `:direction` and `go|walk|run :direction`)
- Wrong rule being selected due to confidence/priority sorting issues

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added Semantic Building to EnglishGrammarEngine
**File**: `/mnt/c/repotemp/sharpee/packages/parser-en-us/src/english-grammar-engine.ts`

- Added `buildSemantics()` method to construct semantic properties from rules
- Tracks matched tokens (verb, direction, preposition) during pattern matching
- Applies semantic mappings based on matched tokens:
  - Verb semantics (e.g., 'run' → `{ manner: 'quick' }`)
  - Direction normalization (e.g., 'n' → 'north')
  - Preposition mapping (e.g., 'into' → 'in')

### 2. Fixed Duplicate Semantic Building
**File**: `/mnt/c/repotemp/sharpee/packages/parser-en-us/src/semantic-parser-engine.ts`

- Modified to only apply semantics if not already built by base engine
- Changed condition to check `!match.semantics` before applying

### 3. Improved Match Sorting
**File**: `/mnt/c/repotemp/sharpee/packages/parser-en-us/src/english-grammar-engine.ts`

- Enhanced sorting to consider both confidence and priority:
  ```typescript
  matches.sort((a, b) => {
    if (b.confidence !== a.confidence) {
      return b.confidence - a.confidence;
    }
    return b.rule.priority - a.rule.priority;
  });
  ```

### 4. Removed Confidence Penalty for Alternates
- Alternate matches (e.g., "run" in `go|walk|run...`) no longer receive confidence penalty
- All alternates now treated as equally valid with confidence 1.0

### 5. Enhanced Token Tracking
- Now tracks verbs from both literal patterns and alternates
- Tracks verbs in first position for semantic mapping
- Properly captures direction and preposition slots

## Technical Details

### Semantic Building Flow
1. Pattern matching captures matched tokens (verb, direction, preposition)
2. `buildSemantics()` applies mappings in order:
   - Start with default semantics from rule
   - Apply verb semantics if verb matched
   - Apply direction normalization if direction matched
   - Apply preposition mapping if preposition matched
3. Final semantics attached to `PatternMatch` result

### Debug Features Added
- `PARSER_DEBUG` environment variable for detailed logging
- Logs show semantic building process step-by-step
- Helpful for understanding which rules match and why

## Files Modified
1. `/mnt/c/repotemp/sharpee/packages/parser-en-us/src/english-grammar-engine.ts`
   - Added semantic building logic
   - Improved match sorting
   - Enhanced token tracking

2. `/mnt/c/repotemp/sharpee/packages/parser-en-us/src/semantic-parser-engine.ts`
   - Fixed duplicate semantic application

3. `/mnt/c/repotemp/sharpee/packages/parser-en-us/tests/semantic-parsing.test.ts`
   - Added temporary debug code (later removed)

## Test Results
✅ All 11 semantic parsing tests now passing:
- INSERTING semantics (4 tests) - all passing
- GOING semantics (3 tests) - all passing  
- DROPPING semantics (4 tests) - all passing

## Key Learnings

1. **Semantic Application Timing**: Semantics should be built once during pattern matching, not reapplied later
2. **Priority vs Confidence**: Both factors matter for selecting best match when multiple rules apply
3. **Token Tracking**: Must track all token types (literals, alternates, slots) for proper semantic mapping
4. **Alternate Equality**: Verb alternates should have equal confidence - they're design choices, not ambiguity

## Next Steps
- Consider documenting the semantic building process in ADR
- Review other grammar rules for similar semantic mapping needs
- Potentially refactor to unify semantic building in one place

## Session Duration
~35 minutes (20:00 - 20:34)

## Final Status
✅ All semantic parsing tests passing
✅ Semantic building properly integrated into grammar engine
✅ Pattern matching priorities correctly handled
