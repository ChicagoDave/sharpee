# Session Summary: 2026-02-02 - main

## Status: Completed

## Goals
- Verify whether `packages/platforms/` is still needed in the project
- Confirm whether ts-forge build tool configuration includes platform packages

## Completed

### Platform Package Investigation
- Investigated current usage of `packages/platforms/` directory
- Verified that platforms are actively referenced in:
  - `build.sh` (build script dependencies)
  - `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (workspace package definitions)
  - Root `package.json` (build scripts)
- Confirmed platforms directory contains three packages:
  - `browser-en-us` - Browser platform integration
  - `cli-en-us` - CLI platform integration
  - `test` - Test platform integration

### ts-forge Configuration Verification
- Reviewed `ts-forge.config.json` structure
- Confirmed all three platform packages are already listed in build configuration (lines 23-25)
- No missing packages that would be skipped by the new build tool

## Key Decisions

### 1. Platforms Directory Retained
The `packages/platforms/` directory is still actively used and should not be removed. It serves as the integration layer between the core engine and different runtime environments (browser, CLI, testing).

### 2. ts-forge Migration is Complete for Platforms
The new ts-forge build tool already has proper configuration for all platform packages. No configuration updates needed.

## Open Items

### Short Term
- None - investigative session only

### Long Term
- Continue monitoring ts-forge build tool adoption across the project

## Files Reviewed

**Build Configuration** (3 files):
- `build.sh` - Platform package references
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` - Workspace package definitions
- `ts-forge.config.json` - Build tool package list (lines 23-25)

**Platform Packages** (directory structure):
- `packages/platforms/browser-en-us/` - Browser integration
- `packages/platforms/cli-en-us/` - CLI integration
- `packages/platforms/test/` - Test harness

## Architectural Notes

The platforms packages serve as the glue between the core Sharpee engine and specific runtime environments. Each platform package handles:
- Environment-specific initialization
- I/O integration (terminal, browser DOM, test harness)
- Platform-specific build requirements

This separation maintains clean architecture boundaries between engine code and platform concerns.

## Notes

**Session duration**: ~5 minutes

**Approach**: Quick investigative queries answered through codebase review
