# Session Summary: 2026-02-06 19:00 - main

## Status: In Progress (Platform changes made, testing incomplete)

## Goals
- Continue Tea Room Phase 2: Fix parser collision ("eat eat-me cake") and concealment bugs
- Deep dive into root cause analysis for eating action failure

## Completed

### Deep Assessment: "eat eat-me cake" Parser Failure

**Assessment Document Created**: `docs/work/dungeo/eat-me-cake-assessment.md`

**Key Discovery - Original Diagnosis Was Wrong**:
- Previous session concluded: "The verb 'eat' collides with the entity name 'eat-me'"
- **Actual root cause**: The eating action has NO grammar pattern in `packages/parser-en-us/src/grammar.ts`
- `verbs.ts` only registers "eat" for tokenization/POS tagging, NOT for grammar matching
- This means ALL eating commands fail (`eat cake`, `eat blue cake`, etc.), not just `eat eat-me cake`
- Drinking action has the same gap - no grammar pattern exists

**Impact**: This is a platform gap affecting all stories, not a story-specific naming issue. Entity name collision is a secondary concern that should resolve once grammar patterns exist.

### Platform Fix 1: Added Eating/Drinking Grammar Patterns

**File**: `packages/parser-en-us/src/grammar.ts`

**Changes**:
```typescript
// Added eating action pattern
grammar
  .forAction('if.action.eating')
  .verbs(['eat', 'consume', 'devour'])
  .pattern(':item')
  .where('item', (scope) => scope.visible().matching({ edible: true }))
  .build();

// Added drinking action pattern
grammar
  .forAction('if.action.drinking')
  .verbs(['drink', 'sip', 'quaff'])
  .pattern(':item')
  .where('item', (scope) => scope.visible().matching({ drinkable: true }))
  .build();
```

**Rationale**: Follows existing ADR-087 action-centric pattern used by taking, dropping, opening, etc. These are standard IF verbs that should work for all games, not just Dungeo.

### Platform Fix 2: Concealed Items Filtered from Scope

**File**: `packages/stdlib/src/scope/scope-resolver.ts`

**Problem**: Concealed items (IdentityTrait.concealed=true) were still appearing in scope and could be taken.

**First Attempt (Failed)**:
- Used `IdentityBehavior.isConcealed(entity)` helper
- This threw errors on entities without IdentityTrait (most entities)
- Broke "look" command across ALL walkthroughs - immediate regression

**Second Attempt (Solution)**:
- Added safe `isConcealed()` helper function:
```typescript
function isConcealed(entity: IFEntity): boolean {
  if (!entity.has(TraitType.IDENTITY)) return false;
  const identityTrait = entity.getTrait(TraitType.IDENTITY) as IdentityTrait;
  return identityTrait.concealed ?? false;
}
```

- Added concealment check to all scope methods:
  - `getScope()` - filters concealed from all visible entities
  - `getVisible()` - filters concealed from visible entities
  - `getReachable()` - filters concealed from reachable entities
  - `getAudible()` - filters concealed from audible entities

**Rationale**: Concealed items should not appear in any scope query. The safe helper avoids throwing on entities without IdentityTrait.

## Known Issues / Needs Testing

1. **Build interrupted before final verification** - Need to rebuild and run full walkthrough chain
2. **Entity resolution issue observed**: Initial test showed grammar fix worked (parser resolved "eat eat-me cake") but entity lookup returned "You can't see any such thing" - may need entity alias investigation or scope debugging
3. **Safe concealment fix untested** - Build was killed before verification
4. **cake-mechanics.transcript needs updates** - Once both fixes are verified working

## Files Modified

**Platform Changes**:
- `packages/parser-en-us/src/grammar.ts` - Added eating + drinking grammar patterns (NEW standard IF verbs)
- `packages/stdlib/src/scope/scope-resolver.ts` - Added concealment filtering to all scope methods

**Documentation**:
- `docs/work/dungeo/eat-me-cake-assessment.md` - NEW: Deep parser assessment document with root cause analysis

## Key Decisions

### 1. Grammar Patterns Added to Platform, Not Story

**Decision**: Added eating/drinking grammar patterns to `packages/parser-en-us/src/grammar.ts` rather than story grammar extension.

**Rationale**: These are standard IF verbs that should work for all games. Missing grammar patterns are a platform gap, not a story-specific need. Story grammar should be reserved for story-specific verbs (SAY, INCANT, RING, etc.).

### 2. Safe isConcealed() Helper vs Behavior Method

**Decision**: Created safe helper function that checks for IdentityTrait existence before accessing, rather than using `IdentityBehavior.isConcealed()`.

**Rationale**: The behavior method uses `require()` which throws on entities without the trait. Most entities don't have IdentityTrait, so this breaks core actions like "look". The safe helper gracefully returns false for entities without the trait.

### 3. Filter Concealment at Scope Level, Not Action Level

**Decision**: Added concealment filtering to all scope resolver methods rather than individual action validators.

**Rationale**: Concealment is a visibility concern, not an action-specific concern. Filtering at the scope level ensures concealed items are invisible to ALL actions (take, examine, search, etc.) without requiring each action to implement custom concealment logic.

## Open Items

### Immediate (Next Session)
- **Rebuild and verify** - Run full walkthrough chain to verify no regressions from scope changes
- **Investigate entity resolution** - Debug why "eat eat-me cake" returns "can't see any such thing" after grammar fix
- **Update cake-mechanics.transcript** - Once both fixes are working, update unit test expectations
- **Audit other missing grammar patterns** - Check wear, climb, lock, unlock, etc. for similar gaps

### Later Phases
- Phase 3: Robot & cage puzzle
- Phase 4: Low Room carousel
- Phase 5: wt-09 walkthrough

## Architectural Notes

### Grammar Pattern Completeness Gap

This session revealed a systematic gap: several stdlib actions have no grammar patterns registered. Actions exist and work IF you can parse the command, but the parser can't recognize the commands.

**Verified Missing** (this session):
- eating - FIXED this session
- drinking - FIXED this session

**Potentially Missing** (needs audit):
- wearing
- climbing
- locking/unlocking (may only have "lock X with Y" but not "lock X")
- sleeping

**Recommendation**: Systematic audit of `packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/*/` vs `packages/parser-en-us/src/grammar.ts` to find all gaps.

### Scope Filtering Philosophy

The concealment fix establishes a principle: **scope queries should pre-filter by visibility traits**. This keeps action validators simple - they query scope and trust the results, rather than implementing custom filtering logic.

Potential future enhancements:
- Filter by light level (can't see in darkness)
- Filter by distance (can't reach distant objects)
- Filter by perception (can't hear silent objects)

All of these are scope-level concerns, not action-level concerns.

## Notes

**Session duration**: ~1.5 hours

**Approach**:
1. Deep root cause analysis (challenging assumptions from previous session)
2. Research-driven fix (reading grammar.ts, verbs.ts, scope-resolver.ts)
3. Safe implementation (helper function to avoid trait requirement errors)

**Build Status**: Interrupted before final verification - all changes are code-complete but untested.

**Test Status**: Unknown - need rebuild + full walkthrough chain run.
