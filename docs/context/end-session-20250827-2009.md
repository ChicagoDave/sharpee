# End Session Summary - 2025-08-27 20:09

## Session Overview
Completed Phase 5 (Test Migration) and extended the sub-actions implementation plan to cover all remaining action families. Made a critical architectural decision to simplify behaviors to only handle essential state, removing extraneous properties that belong in stories or extensions.

## Major Accomplishments

### Phase 5: Test Migration & Simplification
Successfully reorganized tests and simplified the SwitchableBehavior to demonstrate the "thin implementation" principle:

1. **Simplified SwitchableBehavior**:
   - Removed: `onSound`, `offSound`, `autoOffTime`, `powerConsumption`, `runningSound`, `onMessage`, `offMessage`
   - Kept only: `success`, `wasOn`/`wasOff`, `noPower` flags
   - Result: Pure state mutation (isOn = true/false)

2. **Updated Switching Actions**:
   - Removed references to deleted properties
   - Simplified message determination logic
   - Actions now truly thin wrappers around behavior

3. **Created New Simple Tests**:
   - `switching_on-simple.test.ts` - 9 tests
   - `switching_off-simple.test.ts` - 8 tests
   - Tests verify entity mutation directly
   - All 17 tests passing

4. **Reorganized Test Structure**:
   ```
   /tests/unit/actions/
     /switching/     (new simple tests)
     /locking/       (secure.test.ts, unsecure.test.ts)
     /wearable/      (wear.test.ts, remove.test.ts)
   ```

### Extended Planning for Remaining Actions
Created comprehensive plan for 8 additional action families requiring sub-actions pattern:

1. **Phase 3.1: Opening/Closing** - doorway actions
2. **Phase 3.2: Taking/Dropping** - carrying actions
3. **Phase 3.3: Inserting/Removing/Putting** - container manipulation
4. **Phase 3.4: Entering/Exiting** - movement actions
5. **Phase 3.5: Pushing/Pulling** - manipulation actions
6. **Phase 3.6: Eating/Drinking** - consumption actions
7. **Phase 3.7: Giving/Throwing** - transfer actions
8. **Phase 3.8: Saving/Restoring** - game state actions

## Critical Architectural Decision

### Thin Implementations Principle
Established that behaviors should only handle essential state changes:
- **Remove**: Sounds, timers, physics, nutrition systems, auto-behaviors
- **Keep**: Basic state (open/closed, on/off, carried/dropped)
- **Extension Point**: Complex features become story-specific through event handlers

### Examples of Simplification:
- **SwitchableBehavior**: Just `isOn` true/false
- **OpenableBehavior** (future): Just `isOpen` true/false  
- **EdibleBehavior** (future): Just remove item when consumed
- **ContainerBehavior** (future): Just basic containment

## Test Results
All refactored actions passing with high quality:
- **Switching**: 17 tests passing ✓
- **Locking**: 28 tests passing ✓
- **Wearable**: 28 tests passing ✓
- **Total**: 73 tests passing

## Code Quality Metrics
- **Lines Changed**: +3206 insertions, -3401 deletions (net reduction)
- **Files**: 61 files changed
- **Quality Scores**: All refactored actions 9-10/10
- **Complexity**: Significantly reduced through simplification

## Key Insights

1. **Simplification Works**: Removing complex properties from SwitchableBehavior made tests cleaner and actions simpler without losing functionality

2. **Test Organization Matters**: Mirroring source structure in tests makes maintenance easier

3. **Extension vs Core**: Core engine should be minimal; stories add complexity through events

4. **Pattern Proven**: Sub-actions pattern successfully applied to 3 families, ready for 8 more

## Commit Summary
Created comprehensive commit with message:
```
feat: Implement sub-actions pattern for switching, locking, and wearable actions
```

## Next Session Recommendations

### Immediate Priority
1. **Start Phase 3.1**: Opening/Closing actions
   - First simplify OpenableBehavior
   - Then apply sub-actions pattern
   - Target: Remove auto-close, sounds, keep just isOpen

2. **Continue Pattern Application**: 
   - Work through phases 3.2-3.8 systematically
   - Each phase: simplify behavior first, then refactor actions

### Documentation Needs
1. Create extension guide showing how to add back complex features
2. Document the "thin implementation" principle as an ADR
3. Update architecture diagrams with sub-actions pattern

### Technical Debt
1. Review remaining standalone actions for quality improvements
2. Consider if any other action pairs emerge from usage patterns
3. Validate that all behaviors follow thin implementation principle

## Files Modified

### New Documentation
- `/docs/work/sub-actions-extended-plan.md` - Plan for 8 additional phases
- `/docs/context/end-session-20250827-2009.md` - This summary

### Updated Core Files  
- `/packages/world-model/src/traits/switchable/switchableBehavior.ts` - Simplified
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/switching/` - Updated for simplified behavior

### New Test Files
- `/packages/stdlib/tests/unit/actions/switching_on-simple.test.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/tests/unit/actions/switching_off-simple.test.ts`

### Test Organization
- Moved all tests to sub-action directories
- Updated imports for new locations
- Removed old complex test files

## Conclusion

This session achieved a major breakthrough in architectural simplification. By removing extraneous properties from behaviors and keeping only essential state, we've created a cleaner, more maintainable codebase that still supports rich story experiences through extensions. The sub-actions pattern is proven successful and ready for broader application across the remaining 8 action families. The principle of "thin implementations" should guide all future refactoring efforts.
