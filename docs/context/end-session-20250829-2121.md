# Work Session Summary - World Events and ActionContext.sharedData

## Date: 2025-08-29
## Session Duration: ~2.5 hours  
## Focus: Simplifying world events implementation and solving context pollution

---

## Major Breakthrough: ActionContext.sharedData

### Problem Discovered
The three-phase action pattern (validate → execute → report) had a fundamental issue:
- `execute()` returns void
- `report()` needs to know what happened during execute
- No clean way to pass data between phases
- Current solution uses context pollution: `(context as any)._previousLocation`

### Solution Evolution
1. **Initial idea**: MoveResult complex return type from world.moveEntity()
2. **Realization**: This overcomplicates the world API
3. **Better idea**: Change execute() to return data
4. **Best solution**: Add `sharedData` property to ActionContext!

### Final Solution
```typescript
interface ActionContext {
  // ... existing properties ...
  sharedData: Record<string, any>;  // For passing data between phases
}

// In execute(): Store data
context.sharedData.previousLocation = context.world.getLocation(item.id);
context.sharedData.wasWorn = item.has(TraitType.WEARABLE) && item.wearable.worn;

// In report(): Access data
const { previousLocation, wasWorn } = context.sharedData;
```

## Work Completed

### 1. World Events Design Documents
Created comprehensive documentation in `/docs/work/world/`:
- **`world-events-comprehensive-design.md`** - Analyzed all IWorldModel operations
- **`world-events-decision-matrix.md`** - Compared three approaches (return only, events only, hybrid)
- **`world-events-implementation-plan.md`** - Implementation plan with phases
- **`world-events-implementation-checklist.md`** - Detailed task checklist

### 2. Simplified World Events Approach
After initial complex designs with MoveResult, arrived at simpler solution:
- World methods keep simple returns (boolean, entity)
- World emits events for observation (witness, debugging)
- Actions capture context before mutations
- Actions use sharedData to pass context to report phase
- NO complex return types needed

### 3. ActionContext.sharedData Documentation
Created implementation docs in `/docs/work/stdlib/`:
- **`update-actioncontext-plan.md`** - Plan for adding sharedData
- **`update-actioncontext-checklist.md`** - Step-by-step implementation checklist

### 4. Taking Action Refactor Documents
Updated `/docs/work/taking/`:
- **`implementation-plan.md`** - Updated to use sharedData approach
- **`three-phase-data-flow-proposal.md`** - Analyzed data flow options
- **`actioncontext-shared-data-proposal.md`** - Detailed sharedData proposal

### 5. Updated ADR-064
- Removed MoveResult complexity
- Added ActionContext.sharedData as the solution
- Updated examples to show new pattern
- Clarified that world keeps simple API

## Key Decisions

### 1. No MoveResult
- World.moveEntity() continues returning boolean
- Keeps world API simple and unchanged
- Actions capture what they need before mutations

### 2. ActionContext.sharedData
- Clean solution for passing data between phases
- No breaking changes to command-executor
- Eliminates context pollution
- Simple Record<string, any> for flexibility

### 3. World Events for Observation
- World emits events when state changes
- Synchronous emission (no async complexity)
- Only successful operations emit events
- Events include turn and timestamp for ordering

### 4. Event Timing Is Fine
- World events emit during execute() (immediate)
- Action events created in report() (slightly later)
- Same turn, same game state, different purposes
- World events for real-time observation
- Action events for game logic/narrative

### 5. Resolved Open Questions
- **Query operations**: NO events (performance)
- **Failed operations**: NO events (reduce noise)
- **Event batching**: NO for now (keep simple)
- **Sync vs Async**: SYNC (never multi-player)
- **Event ordering**: Turn + timestamp

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: ActionContext.sharedData (Prerequisite)
1. Add sharedData to ActionContext interface
2. Initialize in createActionContext factory
3. Test with simple action

### Phase 2: World Events
1. Add event emitter to WorldModel
2. Emit events from mutations (keep simple returns)
3. Remove platform.world.* events

### Phase 3: Taking Action
1. Use sharedData instead of context pollution
2. Capture context before mutations
3. Store in sharedData for report phase

### Phase 4: Other Actions
1. Find all context pollution patterns
2. Migrate to sharedData one by one
3. Remove all `(context as any)._*`

## Files Created/Modified

### New Documentation
- `/docs/work/world/` - Complete world events documentation suite
- `/docs/work/stdlib/` - ActionContext update plans
- `/docs/work/taking/` - Additional refactor proposals

### Updated
- `/docs/architecture/adrs/adr-064-world-events-and-action-events.md` - Simplified approach
- `/docs/work/taking/implementation-plan.md` - Use sharedData pattern

## Key Insights

### 1. Simplicity Wins
Started with complex MoveResult, ended with simple sharedData property. The simpler solution is cleaner, more flexible, and easier to implement.

### 2. Context Belongs to Context
ActionContext is the perfect place for shared data - it already flows through all phases, represents the context of executing this action.

### 3. World Should Stay Simple
World mutations should keep their simple boolean/entity returns. Complexity belongs in the action layer, not the world layer.

### 4. Command-Executor Is Key
Understanding that command-executor orchestrates the phases revealed that ActionContext could carry data between them.

### 5. Events Serve Different Masters
World events for observation/debugging, action events for game logic/narrative. They don't need to be perfectly synchronized.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement ActionContext.sharedData** (30 minutes)
2. **Test with taking action** (1 hour)
3. **Add world event emission** (2 hours)
4. **Migrate all actions with context pollution** (4-6 hours)
5. **Update documentation** (1 hour)

## Session Summary

Excellent progress on solving the context pollution problem. Started with overly complex solutions (MoveResult) but through careful analysis and understanding of the command-executor's role, arrived at a much simpler and cleaner solution (ActionContext.sharedData). This maintains backward compatibility while eliminating technical debt. Ready for implementation.
