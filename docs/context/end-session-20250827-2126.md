# End Session Summary - 2025-08-27 21:26

## Session Overview
Successfully completed Phase 3.3 of the sub-actions implementation plan, refactoring inserting/removing/putting actions to follow the established pattern. These actions handle moving items between containers and supporters, with clean separation between validation and state mutation.

## Major Accomplishments

### Phase 3.3: Inserting/Removing/Putting Actions
Implemented sub-actions pattern for container/supporter management:

1. **Core State Identification**:
   - Putting: moves entity to container (in) or supporter (on)
   - Inserting: container-specific putting (delegates to put)
   - Removing: moves entity from container/supporter to actor
   - All use simple `world.moveEntity()` for state changes

2. **Created Sub-Actions**:
   - `put.ts` - handles core putting logic (43 lines)
   - `insert.ts` - delegates to put sub-action (25 lines)
   - `remove.ts` - handles core removing logic (44 lines)
   - Clean interfaces with IPutContext/IRemoveContext types

3. **Updated Main Actions**:
   - `putting.ts` - delegates to put sub-action
   - `inserting.ts` - delegates to insert sub-action  
   - `removing.ts` - delegates to remove sub-action
   - Preserved all validation logic and behavior compatibility
   - Main actions still use ContainerBehavior/SupporterBehavior for validation

4. **Created Comprehensive Tests**:
   - `put-simple.test.ts` - 5 tests covering containers, supporters, and hybrids
   - `insert-simple.test.ts` - 5 tests covering basic insertion and edge cases
   - `remove-simple.test.ts` - 6 tests covering both container and supporter removal
   - All 16 tests passing with full state verification

### Technical Details

1. **Sub-Action Interfaces**:
   ```typescript
   // Put sub-action
   export interface IPutResult {
     success: boolean;
     targetType: 'container' | 'supporter';
     previousLocation?: string;
   }
   
   // Remove sub-action
   export interface IRemoveResult {
     success: boolean;
     sourceType: 'container' | 'supporter';
     previousLocation?: string;
   }
   ```

2. **Consistent Pattern**:
   - All sub-actions follow: `(item, target, world) => Result`
   - Use `IWorldModel` interface for world access
   - Direct state mutation via `world.moveEntity()`
   - Return simple result objects with success status

3. **Delegation Pattern**:
   - Insert delegates to put (since inserting is container-specific putting)
   - Reduces code duplication
   - Maintains single source of truth for state mutations

## Code Quality Metrics
- **Tests**: 16 tests all passing (5 put, 5 insert, 6 remove)
- **Coverage**: Complete coverage of basic operations and edge cases
- **Simplicity**: Sub-actions average ~40 lines each
- **Type Safety**: Successfully builds with TypeScript, proper interface usage

## Key Insights

1. **Delegation Works Well**: Insert delegating to put shows how sub-actions can build on each other
2. **Behavior Independence**: These actions don't need complex trait behaviors, just location changes
3. **Pattern Consistency**: Following the same pattern as taking/dropping makes the codebase predictable
4. **Test Simplification**: Direct world access in tests makes them easier to write and understand

## Next Session Recommendations

### Continue with Phase 3.4: Entering/Exiting
These actions involve moving actors between rooms/containers:
- Similar to removing/putting but for actors
- May need to handle special cases for room transitions
- Apply same sub-actions pattern

### Pattern Application Progress:
- ✅ Phase 3.1: Opening/Closing (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Phase 3.2: Taking/Dropping (COMPLETE) 
- ✅ Phase 3.3: Inserting/Removing/Putting (COMPLETE)
- ⬜ Phase 3.4: Entering/Exiting
- ⬜ Phase 3.5: Pushing/Pulling
- ⬜ Phase 3.6: Eating/Drinking
- ⬜ Phase 3.7: Giving/Throwing
- ⬜ Phase 3.8: Saving/Restoring

## Files Modified

### Sub-Actions Created
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/putting/sub-actions/put.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/inserting/sub-actions/insert.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/removing/sub-actions/remove.ts`

### Main Actions Updated
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/putting/putting.ts` - Delegates to sub-action
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/inserting/inserting.ts` - Delegates to sub-action
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/removing/removing.ts` - Delegates to sub-action

### Test Files Created
- `/packages/stdlib/tests/unit/actions/putting/put-simple.test.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/tests/unit/actions/inserting/insert-simple.test.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/tests/unit/actions/removing/remove-simple.test.ts`

### Type Fixes Applied
- Updated taking/dropping sub-actions to use `IWorldModel` instead of `IWorldQuery`
- Fixed interface consistency across all sub-actions

## Conclusion
Phase 3.3 successfully demonstrates the sub-actions pattern for complex multi-target actions. The delegation pattern (insert → put) shows how sub-actions can be composed. The clean separation between validation (behaviors) and mutation (sub-actions) continues to prove valuable. All tests passing and TypeScript compilation successful. Ready to continue with Phase 3.4.
