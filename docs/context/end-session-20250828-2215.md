# End Session Summary - 2025-08-28 22:15

## Session Overview
Successfully completed Phase 3.4 of the sub-actions implementation plan, refactoring entering/exiting actions to follow the established pattern. These actions handle movement of actors between rooms, containers, and supporters, with clean separation between validation and state mutation.

## Major Accomplishments

### Phase 3.4: Entering/Exiting Actions
Implemented sub-actions pattern for actor movement:

1. **Core State Identification**:
   - Entering: moves actor from current location into a container/supporter/enterable object
   - Exiting: moves actor from container/supporter to parent location
   - Both handle ENTRY trait with occupants list management
   - Simple `world.moveEntity()` for state changes

2. **Created Sub-Actions**:
   - `enter.ts` - handles core entering logic (87 lines)
   - `exit.ts` - handles core exiting logic (96 lines)
   - Clean interfaces with IEnterResult/IExitResult types
   - Automatic trait addition for ENTRY-only entities (adds CONTAINER/SUPPORTER as needed)

3. **Updated Main Actions**:
   - `entering.ts` - delegates to enter sub-action
   - `exiting.ts` - delegates to exit sub-action with validation check in execute
   - Preserved all validation logic and behavior compatibility
   - Fixed validation to properly handle rooms (containers that shouldn't be exitable)

4. **Created Comprehensive Tests**:
   - `enter-simple.test.ts` - 5 tests covering containers, supporters, and ENTRY trait
   - `exit-simple.test.ts` - 7 tests covering exits and edge cases
   - All 12 tests passing with full state verification
   - All existing golden tests passing (16 entering, 11 exiting)

### Technical Details

1. **Sub-Action Interfaces**:
   ```typescript
   // Enter sub-action
   export interface IEnterResult {
     success: boolean;
     preposition: 'in' | 'on';
     posture?: string;
     previousLocation?: string;
   }
   
   // Exit sub-action
   export interface IExitResult {
     success: boolean;
     fromLocation?: string;
     toLocation?: string;
     preposition: string;
   }
   ```

2. **Key Patterns Applied**:
   - Cast IEntity to IFEntity for trait checking in sub-actions
   - Handle ENTRY trait occupants list management
   - Automatic CONTAINER/SUPPORTER trait addition for ENTRY-only entities
   - Validation check in execute method for proper error handling

3. **Important Fixes**:
   - Rooms are containers but not exitable - added check for ROOM trait
   - Execute method now checks validation to return proper error events
   - World model requires CONTAINER or SUPPORTER for entities to hold others

## Code Quality Metrics
- **Tests**: 28 tests all passing (12 new + 16 existing)
- **Coverage**: Complete coverage of entering/exiting scenarios
- **Simplicity**: Sub-actions under 100 lines each
- **Type Safety**: Successfully builds with TypeScript, proper interface usage

## Key Insights

1. **World Model Constraints**: Entities need CONTAINER or SUPPORTER traits to hold other entities, even with ENTRY trait
2. **Validation in Execute**: Some tests call execute directly, so validation must be checked there too
3. **Room Handling**: Rooms are containers but should not be exitable - requires special case
4. **Trait Composition**: ENTRY trait often needs to work with CONTAINER/SUPPORTER for full functionality

## Next Session Recommendations

### Continue with Phase 3.5: Pushing/Pulling
These actions involve moving objects around:
- Should be simpler than entering/exiting
- May involve direction/location changes
- Apply same sub-actions pattern

### Pattern Application Progress:
- ✅ Phase 3.1: Opening/Closing (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Phase 3.2: Taking/Dropping (COMPLETE) 
- ✅ Phase 3.3: Inserting/Removing/Putting (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Phase 3.4: Entering/Exiting (COMPLETE)
- ⬜ Phase 3.5: Pushing/Pulling
- ⬜ Phase 3.6: Eating/Drinking
- ⬜ Phase 3.7: Giving/Throwing
- ⬜ Phase 3.8: Saving/Restoring

## Files Modified

### Sub-Actions Created
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/entering/sub-actions/enter.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/exiting/sub-actions/exit.ts`

### Main Actions Updated
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/entering/entering.ts` - Delegates to sub-action
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/exiting/exiting.ts` - Delegates to sub-action with validation

### Test Files Created
- `/packages/stdlib/tests/unit/actions/entering/enter-simple.test.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/tests/unit/actions/exiting/exit-simple.test.ts`

### Key Fixes Applied
- Added IFEntity imports and casting in sub-actions
- Added validation check in exiting execute method
- Added ROOM trait check to prevent exiting from rooms
- Auto-add CONTAINER/SUPPORTER for ENTRY-only entities

## Conclusion
Phase 3.4 successfully demonstrates the sub-actions pattern for complex movement actions. The automatic trait addition for ENTRY entities shows how sub-actions can handle world model constraints transparently. The validation-in-execute pattern ensures proper error handling regardless of how actions are invoked. All tests passing and TypeScript compilation successful. Ready to continue with Phase 3.5.
