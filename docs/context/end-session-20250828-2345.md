# End Session Summary - 2025-08-28 23:45

## Session Overview
**Duration**: ~3 hours
**Main Focus**: Understanding the state of three-phase pattern implementation and beginning the conversion of remaining actions

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Implementation Gap Identified
- **Expected**: All actions should use three-phase pattern (validate/execute/report) per ADR-058 and ADR-060
- **Reality**: Only 27.5% (11 actions) actually use three-phase pattern
- **Gap**: 65% (26 actions) still use old pattern where execute returns ISemanticEvent[]

### 2. Previous Work Analysis
The team discovered that while the action-quality-table.md showed improvements were "Complete":
- Bug fixes were done ✅
- Code duplication was removed ✅  
- Quality scores improved ✅
- **BUT** three-phase architectural conversion was NOT done ❌

### 3. Root Cause
- ADR-060 defined a Phase 4: "Migrate All Actions" to three-phase
- Phases 1-3 were completed (infrastructure, prototypes, CommandExecutor refactor)
- **Phase 4 was never executed** - the mass migration didn't happen

## Work Completed

### 1. Repository Setup
- Created backup branch: `main-backup`
- Created fresh working branch: `refactor/three-phase-complete`
- Cleaned up previous branch conflicts

### 2. Documentation Created
- `/docs/work/current-action-state-review.md` - Comprehensive review of all 40 actions
- `/docs/work/sub-actions-analysis.md` - Analysis of which actions need sub-actions pattern
- `/docs/work/three-phase-conversion-plan.md` - Plan for converting 26 actions
- `/docs/work/three-phase-conversion-checklist.md` - Detailed checklist with quality gates
- `/docs/work/three-phase-review-template.md` - Template for reviewing each conversion
- `/docs/work/reviews/entering-pre-conversion-review.md` - Pre-conversion analysis

### 3. First Conversion Started
- **Entering Action**: Successfully converted to three-phase pattern
  - `validate()`: Already good, kept as-is
  - `execute()`: Modified to return void, only mutations
  - `report()`: New method created for all event generation
  - Compilation successful ✅

## Current State

### Actions Status
| Pattern | Count | Percentage | Status |
|---------|-------|------------|--------|
| Three-phase | 12 | 30% | ✅ Including newly converted entering |
| Sub-actions | 3 | 7.5% | ✅ Complete |
| Old pattern | 25 | 62.5% | ❌ Need conversion |

### Quality Requirements Established
- Each action must score 8+/10 before proceeding
- Quality review required after each conversion
- Seven quality metrics defined:
  1. Separation of Concerns (0-2)
  2. Validation Purity (0-2)
  3. Event Completeness (0-2)
  4. Error Handling (0-1)
  5. Code Clarity (0-1)
  6. Type Safety (0-1)
  7. Documentation (0-1)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Priority 1 - Core Actions)
1. Complete entering action review and testing
2. Convert exiting action
3. Convert eating action
4. Convert drinking action
5. Convert attacking action
6. Convert pushing action
7. Convert pulling action

### Phase 2 - Meta Actions
- saving, restoring, quitting, restarting, scoring, about, again

### Phase 3 - Sensory Actions
- listening, smelling, touching, searching, reading

### Phase 4 - Remaining Actions
- showing, talking, throwing, sleeping, waiting, climbing, help

## Important Findings

### Sub-Actions Pattern Clarification
The team clarified that the sub-actions pattern (ADR-063) is ONLY for:
- Truly paired opposite actions
- That have significant code duplication

It should NOT be applied to:
- Opening/Closing (no duplication, already high quality)
- Taking/Dropping (different logic)
- Eating/Drinking (not opposites)
- Giving/Throwing (not opposites)
- Saving/Restoring (not true opposites)

### Technical Debt
- Using `(context as any)._state` pattern for passing state between phases
- This is a temporary solution until proper state passing mechanism is implemented
- All converted actions will need this pattern

## Commits Made
- No commits yet - work in progress on `refactor/three-phase-complete` branch

## Files Modified
1. `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/entering/entering.ts` - Converted to three-phase

## Blockers/Issues
None currently - path forward is clear

## Success Metrics
- Target: 100% of actions using three-phase pattern
- Target: All actions scoring 8+/10 on quality review
- Current: 30% complete (12/40 actions)

## Team Notes
- The previous work claimed completion but only did bug fixes, not architectural changes
- This is essentially completing ADR-060 Phase 4 that was planned but never executed
- Estimated 4 days to complete all 26 remaining actions with proper reviews
