# Session Summary: 2026-02-13 - main (12:45 AM CST)

## Status: Completed

## Goals
- Resolve NPC plugin tick() not firing after restore (continuation from previous session)
- Eliminate dual module resolution issue causing stale code to load
- Clean up debug logging from investigation

## Completed

### 1. Root Cause: Dual Module Resolution (dist/ vs dist-npm/)

**Problem Identified**: The NPC serialization fix from the previous session (replacing `npcTrait.canAct` getter with property access) was correct but didn't resolve the issue. The `NPC-TICK` log still never appeared after `$restore`, even though `ENGINE-PLUGINS` confirmed plugins were executing.

**Root Cause**: All 19 packages had `package.json` with `"main": "./dist-npm/index.js"`, but the esbuild bundle used `./dist/index.js`. When the story dynamically loaded `@sharpee/plugin-npc` at runtime via `require()`, Node's module resolution followed `package.json` and loaded `dist-npm/npc-service.js` - which contained the **old, unfixed code** still using `npcTrait.canAct`. The bundle's copy in `dist/` had the fix but was a separate module instance.

This created two separate copies of every module in memory - one from the bundle (`dist/`) and one from Node's require cache (`dist-npm/`). The plugin registration happened with one instance, but the service method calls went to a different instance.

### 2. Solution: Eliminated dist-npm Entirely

Removed the dual-output pattern and unified on a single `dist/` directory for both local development and npm publishing.

**Package Configuration** (19 files):
- Updated `package.json` in all packages: `engine`, `stdlib`, `world-model`, `parser-en-us`, `lang-en-us`, `transcript-tester`, `plugin-npc`, `plugin-meta-actions`, `web`, `terminal`, `game-session`, `story-loader`, `react-client`, `zifmia-client`, and 5 story packages
- Changed `main`, `module`, `types` fields: `./dist-npm/` → `./dist/`
- Updated `exports` map paths: `./dist-npm/` → `./dist/`
- Updated `files` array to include `dist` instead of `dist-npm`
- Updated `build:npm` script target directory

**Build Configuration**:
- `ts-forge.config.json` - Updated npm target `outDir` from `dist-npm` to `dist`
- `.gitignore` - Removed `dist-npm` entry
- `build-macos.sh` - Removed symlink creation block (7 lines)
- `build-ubuntu.sh` - Removed symlink creation block (7 lines)

**Documentation**:
- `website/src/pages/docs/developer-guide/build-system.mdx` - Removed dist-npm documentation, updated npm publishing section

**Cleanup**:
- Deleted all 19 `packages/*/dist-npm/` directories

### 3. Debug Logging Cleanup

Removed temporary debug logs added during investigation:
- `packages/engine/src/game-engine.ts` line ~637 - `[ENGINE-PLUGINS]` log
- `packages/stdlib/src/npc/npc-service.ts` line ~173 - `[NPC-TICK]` log

### 4. Verification

**Build Results**:
- Clean build successful
- Bundle loads in 177ms (consistent with previous sessions)

**Test Results**:
- Walkthrough chain: 335 pass, 7 fail, 9 skip (1453ms)
- NPC tick confirmed working after restore - `[THIEF-TURN]` logs fire every turn
- Remaining 7 failures are pre-existing thief deposit timing issues (unrelated to this fix)

## Key Decisions

### 1. Single Output Directory (dist/) for All Use Cases

Eliminated the `dist/` vs `dist-npm/` dual output pattern entirely. This architectural decision prevents module duplication bugs where Node's `require()` could load two different copies of the same package.

**Rationale**:
- The dual-output pattern was originally introduced to support different module formats (CJS for npm, ESM for bundling)
- Modern build tools handle both formats from a single directory
- The complexity and risk of module duplication outweighs any organizational benefit
- TypeScript's `exports` map provides fine-grained control over what's exposed

### 2. Build Scripts Don't Need Symlink Workarounds

Removed symlink creation from platform build scripts. The original purpose (ensuring npm installs could resolve packages) is now handled correctly by having `package.json` point to the same `dist/` that builds produce.

## Open Items

### Short Term
- Resolve remaining 7 wt-12 failures (thief deposit timing issues in egg/canary/bauble/chalice sequence)
- These failures are unrelated to the NPC plugin tick issue - the thief is now moving/acting correctly, but treasure deposit logic needs tuning

### Long Term
- Monitor for any npm publishing issues (though unlikely - all packages now have consistent paths)
- Consider documenting the module resolution investigation in an ADR (explains why single dist/ is required)

## Architectural Notes

### Module Resolution in Node.js

This session revealed how Node's `require()` resolves packages:
1. Looks for `package.json` in the package directory
2. Reads `main` field (or `exports` map for modern packages)
3. Loads the file at that path
4. Caches the module in `require.cache`

When the bundle uses `dist/index.js` but `package.json` points to `dist-npm/index.js`, Node loads TWO copies of the module - one for the bundle, one for runtime requires. Singletons break, service registrations fail, and methods appear to not exist.

### Why Getters Still Don't Work After This Fix

The serialization issue with `npcTrait.canAct` getter remains fundamental - getters don't survive JSON round-tripping. The previous session's fix (using `npcTrait.isAlive && npcTrait.isConscious` instead) is still required. This session's fix was about ensuring that corrected code actually runs (not stale code from dist-npm/).

### Platform Pattern: Single Source of Truth for Module Paths

All packages now follow this pattern:
- Build output goes to `dist/`
- Package.json points to `dist/`
- Bundle imports from `dist/`
- Runtime requires resolve to `dist/`

One directory, one module instance, no duplication.

## Notes

**Session duration**: ~1.5 hours

**Approach**: Continued investigation from previous session. Traced module resolution path, discovered dual-output pattern was causing stale code to load. Made architectural decision to eliminate dist-npm entirely rather than trying to keep both directories in sync.

**Test Coverage**: Full walkthrough chain confirms NPC system now works correctly after restore operations.

**Context State**: Bug resolved, all code cleaned up, ready for thief deposit timing work.
