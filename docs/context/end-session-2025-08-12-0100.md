# Session Summary - 2025-08-12 01:00

## Overview
Successfully completed the removal of the ActionBehavior system (ADR-051) and implementation of the Event Handler system (ADR-052), achieving a major architectural simplification aligned with interactive fiction authoring needs.

## Key Accomplishments

### Phase 1: Complete Removal of ActionBehavior System ✅
- Deleted `/packages/stdlib/src/action-behaviors/` directory (~2000 lines)
- Deleted `/packages/stdlib/tests/unit/action-behaviors/` test directory
- Reverted `pushing.ts` and `pulling.ts` to original state
- Updated ADR-051 to mark as superseded by ADR-052
- Removed all ActionBehavior documentation and work files
- Verified clean build with no ActionBehavior references

### Phase 2: Full Implementation of Event Handler System ✅

#### Core Infrastructure
- Created event types in `/packages/world-model/src/events/types.ts`
  - `GameEvent` interface for game events
  - `EntityEventHandler` type (renamed from EventHandler to avoid conflicts)
  - `EventHandlers` collection interface
  
- Extended `IFEntity` with event handling capability
  - Added `on?: EventHandlers` property for entity-level handlers
  
- Created `EventEmitter` class in `/packages/engine/src/events/event-emitter.ts`
  - Full pub/sub implementation with on/off/emit/clear
  - Returns collected SemanticEvents from handlers
  
- Added `StoryWithEvents` class in `/packages/engine/src/story.ts`
  - Story-level event handling (daemons)
  - Uses EventEmitter internally

#### Command Executor Integration
- Updated `/packages/engine/src/command-executor.ts` with event handler support
  - Phase 3: Check entity-level handlers after action execution
  - Phase 4: Support for story-level handlers (ready for future integration)
  - Combines events from all handlers with action events

#### Helper Utilities
Created `/packages/stdlib/src/events/helpers.ts` with common patterns:
- `createToggleHandler` - Toggle switches
- `createOpenHandler` - Open things when triggered
- `createRevealHandler` - Reveal hidden passages
- `createMessageHandler` - Display custom messages
- `composeHandlers` - Combine multiple handlers
- `createOnceHandler` - Fire only once
- `createAfterHandler` - Fire after N times
- `createConditionalHandler` - Conditional execution

#### Comprehensive Testing
- Unit tests for EventEmitter (all passing)
- Integration tests for event handler system (all passing)
  - Entity-level handlers
  - Story-level handlers
  - Handler composition
  - Complex multi-entity interactions (three statues puzzle)

7. `/docs/architecture/adrs/adr-051-action-behaviors.md` - Marked superseded

### Files Deleted (~30+)
- All ActionBehavior implementation files
- All ActionBehavior test files
- All ActionBehavior documentation

## Metrics
- **Lines removed**: ~2000+ (ActionBehavior system)
- **Lines added**: ~600 (Event handler system)
- **Net simplification**: ~1400 lines
- **Build status**: All packages building successfully
- **Test status**: All event handler tests passing
- **Time**: ~1.5 hours

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Event Handlers Won
1. **Simplicity**: Direct cause-and-effect without abstraction layers
2. **Flexibility**: Every entity can have unique behavior
3. **Author-friendly**: Matches how IF authors think about interactions
4. **No serialization issues**: Handlers are code, rebuilt on load

### Event Flow Architecture
1. Action executes and emits events (e.g., `if.event.pushed`)
2. CommandExecutor checks entity handlers
3. CommandExecutor checks story handlers (when integrated)
4. All returned events are combined and processed
5. World state updates based on events

## Example Usage

```typescript
// Entity-level handler
book.on = {
  'if.event.pushed': (event) => {
    return [{
      type: 'if.event.opened',
      data: { entity: bookshelf.id },
      // ... other event properties
    }];
  }
};

// Story-level handler (daemon)
story.on('if.event.pushed', (event) => {
  if (allStatuesPushed()) {
    return [{ type: 'if.event.puzzle_solved', /*...*/ }];
  }
});
```

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

### Documentation Needed
- Author-facing guide for event handlers
- Migration guide from ActionBehaviors (if needed)
- Best practices and patterns

### Example Stories
- Push book → open bookshelf
- Three statues puzzle
- Crystal ball that breaks when thrown

## Insights

1. **"Events without handlers are just logs"** - This fundamental realization drove the entire pivot

2. **No generic patterns in IF** - Every button, lever, and pushable object does something unique to the story

3. **Composition over abstraction** - Simple event handlers beat complex class hierarchies

4. **Bottom-up design works** - We discovered the issue by trying to implement real scenarios
