# Session Summary: 20260126 - main

## Status: Complete

## Goals
- Fix version mismatch between laptop and Ubuntu server builds

## Completed
- Diagnosed version discrepancy in browser bundle
- Updated browser-en-us package version from `1.0.0-beta` to `1.0.64-beta`
- Rebuilt dungeo for browser client
- Verified correct versions in website public files

## Key Decisions
- Browser platform package version should match story version for consistency
- The `1.0.0-beta` string in bundle was from error message text in engine/story.ts, not an actual version value

## Open Items
- None

## Files Modified
- `packages/platforms/browser-en-us/package.json` - Updated version to 1.0.64-beta
- `packages/platforms/browser-en-us/src/version.ts` - Auto-regenerated by build.sh
- `website/public/games/dungeo/*` - Updated with fresh build

## Technical Details

### Issue
User reported that building dungeo on laptop produced correct story object with version `1.0.64-beta`, but Ubuntu server was producing different output.

### Root Cause
The `packages/platforms/browser-en-us/package.json` had a stale version (`1.0.0-beta`) that didn't match the dungeo story version (`1.0.64-beta`). The build.sh script reads version from package.json to generate version.ts files.

### Fix
Updated browser-en-us package.json version to match dungeo, then rebuilt with:
```bash
bash build.sh -s dungeo -c browser
```

### Verification
- Confirmed `1.0.64-beta` appears in bundle
- Confirmed website/public/games/dungeo/ files are current
- Game VERSION command shows correct versions
