# Session Summary - August 23, 2025 17:21

## Session Overview
Completed Phase 3.1 of the atomic events refactor, migrating 6 additional core actions to the three-phase pattern. During Phase 3.2 implementation, discovered a significant design flaw in CommandExecutor that led to proposing a major architectural improvement.

## Major Accomplishments

### Phase 3.1 Completion - 6 Actions Migrated âœ…

#### 1. Dropping Action
- Split into validate/execute/report phases
- Execute: Delegates to ActorBehavior.dropItem()
- Report: Captures item, actor, and location snapshots
- All 15 tests passing

#### 2. Opening Action  
- Execute: Delegates to OpenableBehavior.open()
- Report: Captures target and contents snapshots
- Handles containers, doors, and supporters
- All 12 tests passing

#### 3. Closing Action
- Execute: Delegates to OpenableBehavior.close()
- Report: Captures target and contents snapshots
- Maintains consistency with opening action
- All 13 tests passing

#### 4. Putting Action
- Complex action handling both containers ('in') and supporters ('on')
- Execute: Delegates to ContainerBehavior or SupporterBehavior
- Report: Captures item and target snapshots
- All 27 tests passing

#### 5. Inserting Action
- Delegates to putting action with 'in' preposition
- Execute: Calls putting.execute()
- Report: Calls putting.report()
- All 13 tests passing

#### 6. Removing Action
- Two-phase execution: remove from source, then take
- Execute: Uses ContainerBehavior/SupporterBehavior and ActorBehavior
- Report: Captures item, actor, and source snapshots
- All 18 tests passing

### Architectural Discovery - CommandExecutor Design Flaw

While starting Phase 3.2 (validation event updates), discovered that `CommandExecutor` has become a 700+ line god object with too many responsibilities:
- Parser integration
- Validation orchestration
- Action execution
- Event factory
- Error handling
- Context creation
- Backward compatibility

This violates SOLID principles and makes the codebase harder to maintain.

### Architectural Decision - ADR-060

Created ADR-060 proposing to refactor CommandExecutor into a thin orchestrator (~100 lines) where:
- Actions own their complete lifecycle through validate/execute/report
- The report() phase creates ALL events (success and error)
- CommandExecutor only orchestrates the phases
- Each component (parser, validator, actions) creates its own events

## Files Modified

### Actions Migrated (6 files + 6 event type files)
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/dropping/dropping.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/dropping/dropping-events.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/opening/opening.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/opening/opening-events.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/closing/closing.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/closing/closing-event-data.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/putting/putting.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/inserting/inserting.ts`
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/removing/removing.ts`

### Test Files Updated (6 files)
- Added helper functions to handle both old and new execution patterns
- All tests passing without modification to test logic

### Documentation Created
- `/docs/architecture/adrs/adr-060-command-executor-refactor.md`
- Updated `/docs/work/atomic-events-checklist.md` with Phase 3.5

## Test Results
- **Total actions migrated**: 10 (4 from previous session + 6 today)
- **Total tests passing**: 148 action tests
- **Backward compatibility**: 100% maintained

## Key Insights

### The Three-Phase Pattern is Powerful
The validate/execute/report pattern not only enables atomic events but also provides a clean separation of concerns that could solve other architectural issues.

### CommandExecutor Reveals Deeper Pattern
The discovery that CommandExecutor is doing too much suggests that the three-phase pattern should be the primary architectural pattern, with CommandExecutor merely orchestrating.

### Report Phase Should Own All Events
Having the report() phase create ALL events (including errors) provides:
- Consistent event creation with full context
- Better encapsulation
- Simpler testing
- Clearer responsibilities

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 3.5)
1. Refactor CommandExecutor to thin orchestrator
2. Update actions to handle error events in report()
3. Complete Phase 3.2 with proper architecture

### Future Phases
- Phase 4: Text Service refactor (remove world model dependencies)
- Phase 5: Story updates
- Phase 6: Engine updates

## Recommendation
**COMMIT NOW** - The work is stable, tests are passing, and we've documented the architectural discovery. This provides a clean checkpoint before the CommandExecutor refactor.

## Proposed Commit Message
```
feat: Complete Phase 3.1 of atomic events refactor - migrate 6 core actions

- Migrated dropping, opening, closing, putting, inserting, removing to three-phase pattern
- All actions now capture complete entity snapshots in events
- Maintained 100% backward compatibility
- 148 tests passing across all migrated actions
- Discovered CommandExecutor design flaw, documented in ADR-060
- Added Phase 3.5 to checklist for CommandExecutor refactor
