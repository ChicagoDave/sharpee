# Session Summary: 2026-02-16 - main (1:12 AM CST)

## Status: Completed

## Goals
- Investigate and fix the `tie braided wire to hook` ENTITY_NOT_FOUND bug from previous sessions
- Understand why `setMinimumScope()` wasn't working for entities when player is in a vehicle

## Completed

### Critical Bug Fixed: `canContain()` Missing VEHICLE and ENTERABLE Traits

**Root Cause Identified**: The `canContain()` utility function in `packages/world-model/src/traits/container/container-utils.ts` only recognized 4 trait types:
- CONTAINER
- ROOM
- ACTOR
- SUPPORTER

It did NOT recognize:
- ENTERABLE
- VEHICLE

**Impact**: When code called `world.moveEntity(player.id, balloon.id)` to move the player into the balloon, it silently failed because `canMoveEntity()` → `canContain()` returned `false`. The player was never actually inside the balloon.

**Why This Broke Scope Resolution**:
- The `setMinimumScope()` mechanism works correctly
- The hook's minimum scope was properly set to REACHABLE for entities in the balloon's room
- BUT the player wasn't actually contained by the balloon, so the scope check failed
- Result: "tie braided wire to hook" → ENTITY_NOT_FOUND

**Fix**: One-line change in `canContain()`:
```typescript
// Added ENTERABLE and VEHICLE to the trait type check
return entity.hasTrait(TraitType.CONTAINER) ||
       entity.hasTrait(TraitType.ROOM) ||
       entity.hasTrait(TraitType.ACTOR) ||
       entity.hasTrait(TraitType.SUPPORTER) ||
       entity.hasTrait(TraitType.ENTERABLE) ||  // ADDED
       entity.hasTrait(TraitType.VEHICLE);      // ADDED
```

### Unit Tests Added

Added 3 comprehensive tests to `packages/stdlib/tests/unit/scope/scope-resolver.test.ts`:

1. **should make entity reachable from vehicle room via setMinimumScope**
   - Player in balloon in vairRoom
   - Hook in different ledgeRoom with `setMinimumScope(REACHABLE, [vairRoom])`
   - Verifies hook becomes REACHABLE to player in balloon

2. **should NOT make entity reachable from wrong vehicle room**
   - Same scenario but hook's minimum scope targets a different room
   - Verifies hook stays UNAWARE (doesn't leak scope to wrong locations)

3. **should include vehicle-scoped entities in getReachable**
   - Verifies `getReachable()` correctly returns entities with minimum scope when player is in a vehicle

**Test Results**: All 46 scope resolver tests pass.

## Investigation Path

1. Started by writing a unit test to verify `setMinimumScope()` worked with vehicle containment
2. Test immediately failed: `getScope()` returned UNAWARE (0) instead of REACHABLE (3)
3. Traced through `getScope()` → `getContainingRoom()` → containment chain logic was correct
4. Added debug logging, discovered `world.moveEntity(player.id, balloon.id)` was returning `false`
5. Traced to `canMoveEntity()` → `canContain()` → found missing trait types
6. Fixed `canContain()`, all tests passed
7. Fixed a false positive in one test (hook was accidentally in same room as player, making test pass for wrong reason)

## Key Decisions

### 1. Fix at Platform Level (canContain)
Rather than working around the issue in story code or adding special cases to scope resolution, fixed the root cause in the platform's containment utilities. This ensures all code using `world.moveEntity()` with VEHICLE/ENTERABLE entities works correctly.

### 2. Comprehensive Test Coverage
Added tests for both positive case (minimum scope works) and negative case (doesn't leak to wrong rooms). This prevents regressions and documents the expected behavior.

## Architectural Notes

**Containment System Hierarchy**: The `canContain()` function is the gatekeeper for all entity movement. It must recognize ALL trait types that can contain other entities:
- CONTAINER - boxes, bags, etc.
- SUPPORTER - tables, pedestals, etc.
- ROOM - locations
- ACTOR - NPCs/player inventory
- ENTERABLE - phone booth, booth, etc.
- VEHICLE - balloon, basket, raft, etc.

Missing a trait type causes silent failures in `moveEntity()` (returns `false` but no error).

**Scope Resolution & Vehicles**: The scope system correctly handles vehicles:
1. `getContainingRoom()` walks up containment chain through vehicles to find the room
2. `setMinimumScope()` with room IDs works for entities inside vehicles in those rooms
3. The bug wasn't in scope resolution, it was in the containment system itself

## Files Modified

**Platform** (1 file):
- `packages/world-model/src/traits/container/container-utils.ts` - Added ENTERABLE and VEHICLE to `canContain()`

**Tests** (1 file):
- `packages/stdlib/tests/unit/scope/scope-resolver.test.ts` - Added 3 vehicle scope tests

## Open Items

### Short Term
- Test the actual balloon scenario: `wt-13-volcano-balloon.transcript` should now work correctly
- The `tie braided wire to hook` command should resolve the hook entity properly
- Verify balloon entry/exit works: `enter balloon`, `exit balloon`

### Long Term
- Consider whether other trait types need to be added to `canContain()` (current list should be complete)
- Review other places that check containment to ensure they handle all trait types

## Notes

**Session duration**: ~45 minutes

**Approach**: Test-driven debugging. Wrote the test that should pass, used its failure to locate the root cause, fixed the platform bug.

**Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier**:
- Most entities that contain others use CONTAINER or ROOM traits
- VEHICLE and ENTERABLE are less common
- No unit tests existed for vehicle containment with scope resolution
- The balloon walkthrough wasn't testing basic entry/exit before attempting the wire puzzle

**Significance**: This is a critical platform bug that would affect ANY story using VEHICLE or ENTERABLE entities. The fix is minimal (2 lines) but the impact is substantial.
