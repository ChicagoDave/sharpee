# Session End Summary - 2025-08-27 04:00

## Session Overview
Implemented Phase 1 of the sub-actions pattern (ADR-063) by refactoring switching actions as a pilot. This establishes the architectural foundation for organizing related actions under parent directories with shared base logic.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Sub-Actions Pattern Implementation
Successfully created the first sub-actions implementation with switching actions:

**New Directory Structure:**
```
packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/switching/
├── index.ts                    # Exports and aliases
├── switching-base.ts           # Base class with shared logic
├── switching-events.ts         # Minimal event types
├── activate/
│   ├── activate.ts            # Switching on action
│   └── activate-events.ts     # Activation events
└── deactivate/
    ├── deactivate.ts          # Switching off action
    └── deactivate-events.ts   # Deactivation events
```

### 2. Architectural Improvements

#### Separation of Concerns
- **Actions**: Only responsible for changing switch state (off→on or on→off)
- **Entities**: Handle their own side effects when switched
- **Events**: Contain only essential data (target and targetName)
- **Messages**: Determined by context, not stored in events

#### Code Quality Metrics
- Reduced code duplication through shared base class
- Cleaner validate/execute/report separation
- Removed all debug statements
- Simplified event data structures

### 3. Key Design Decisions

#### Event Data Minimization
**Before**: Events contained presentation details (sounds, lights, power, etc.)
```typescript
interface SwitchedOnEventData {
  target: string;
  targetName: string;
  isLightSource?: boolean;
  willIlluminateLocation?: boolean;
  autoOffTime?: number;
  powerConsumption?: number;
  sound?: string;
  // ... many more fields
}
```

**After**: Events contain only essential state change information
```typescript
interface ActivatedEventData {
  target: string;
  targetName: string;
}
```

**Rationale**: The semantic event should only describe what happened (X was switched on), not how to present it. Presentation logic belongs in the message system.

#### Base Class Pattern
Created `SwitchingBaseAction` abstract class that provides:
- Common validation logic
- Context analysis helpers
- Message selection logic
- Enforces consistent structure

### 4. Test Refactoring
- Rewrote tests to focus on behavior, not implementation details
- Tests now verify that actions emit simple events
- Message selection is tested separately from event structure
- All 24 switching tests passing

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- Deleted: `switching_on/`, `switching_off/`, `switching-shared.ts`
- Created: New switching directory structure (8 new files)
- Updated: `standard/index.ts` to use new structure
- Refactored: Both switching test files to match new design

### Breaking Changes
- None for external consumers (maintained backward compatibility)
- Internal structure completely reorganized
- Event data structure simplified (but events still work the same)

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Lines of Code**: Reduced duplication, cleaner organization
- **Complexity**: Lower cognitive load with clear separation
- **Maintainability**: Adding new sub-actions now straightforward
- **Testing**: Cleaner, more focused tests

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Event Design Philosophy
Events should be minimal and semantic. They describe what happened in the world model, not how to present it to the user. This separation makes the system more flexible and maintainable.

### 2. Sub-Actions Pattern Benefits
- Clear organization for related actions
- Shared logic without duplication
- Semantic naming possibilities (activate/deactivate vs on/off)
- Better support for internationalization

### 3. Test Design
Tests were checking implementation details rather than behavior. Good tests should verify what the action does, not how it does it internally.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 2-3)
1. **Locking/Unlocking**: Apply sub-actions pattern
   - Create `/locking` with `/secure` and `/unsecure`
   - Move shared logic to base class

2. **Wearable Actions**: Apply sub-actions pattern
   - Create `/wearable` with `/wear` and `/remove`
   - Handle implicit taking logic

### Future Considerations
1. **Action Families to Convert**:
   - Opening/Closing
   - Entering/Exiting
   - Taking/Dropping
   - Giving/Showing

2. **Semantic Intent Mapping**:
   - Consider full semantic naming internally
   - Map to traditional IF commands for compatibility

3. **Documentation**:
   - Create migration guide for story authors
   - Document sub-action extension patterns

## Session Statistics
- **Duration**: ~4 hours
- **Files Changed**: 14
- **Tests**: 24 passing (switching), some unrelated failures
- **Architecture**: Successfully validated sub-actions pattern

## Key Takeaway
The sub-actions pattern with minimal semantic events is the right architectural direction. It provides clean separation of concerns, reduces complexity, and makes the codebase more maintainable while preserving backward compatibility.
