## Overview
Completed blood magic extension structure following world model patterns, then identified and planned a major refactoring to add `I` prefix to all interfaces across the entire Sharpee codebase for consistency and architectural clarity.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Blood Magic Extension Restructuring ‚úÖ
Fixed the blood magic extension to follow world model patterns:

#### Structural Changes
- **Trait Organization**: Each trait now has its own directory containing both data (trait) and logic (behavior)
  - `mirrorTrait/mirrorTrait.ts` (data) + `mirrorTrait/mirrorBehavior.ts` (logic)
  - `bloodSilverTrait/` and `bloodMoonTrait/` follow same pattern
- **Grammar Implementation**: Created `blood-grammar.ts` with GrammarBuilder patterns
- **Actions Structure**: Each action in its own directory with main file, events, and index
- **Proper Naming**: Fixed naming conventions (e.g., `blood-moon-trait` ‚Üí `bloodMoonTrait`)

#### Implementation Completed
- **Grammar patterns** for all blood magic commands (touch mirror, connect, enter, touch moon, etc.)
- **Actions implemented**:
  - `touchingMirror` - Touch mirrors to sense connections
  - `connectingMirrors` - Establish portal connections (requires Silver blood)
  - `enteringMirror` - Travel through mirror portals
  - `touchingMoon` - Activate invisibility
  - `forgettingMoon` - Deactivate invisibility
- **Comprehensive test suite**:
  - Unit tests for all traits and behaviors
  - Action validation and execution tests
  - Integration tests for mirror travel and invisibility scenarios

### 2. Identified Architectural Issue üîç
Discovered that blood magic extension can't build because:
- Extensions need interfaces from stdlib (Action, ValidationResult, etc.)
- This creates unwanted coupling - extensions pull in all of stdlib's implementations
- Interfaces and classes with same names cause conflicts when separated

### 3. Planned Major Interface Refactoring üìã
Created comprehensive plan to solve the architectural issues:

#### ADR-053: I-Prefix Convention
- **Decision**: Add `I` prefix to ALL interfaces across entire codebase
- **Rationale**: 
  - Prevents naming conflicts (CommandValidator issue)
  - Improves code clarity (instantly identify contracts vs implementations)
  - Enables separation of interfaces from implementations
  - Industry standard in C# and enterprise TypeScript

#### Refactoring Scope
- **100+ interfaces** to rename across all packages
- **200+ files** affected (virtually every TypeScript file)
- Move IF domain interfaces from stdlib to `@sharpee/if-domain`
- Examples: `Entity` ‚Üí `IEntity`, `Action` ‚Üí `IAction`, `WorldModel` ‚Üí `IWorldModel`

#### Documentation Created
1. **ADR-053** - Architectural decision record for I-prefix convention
2. **Refactoring Plan** - High-level strategy and phases
3. **Detailed Checklist** - Complete list of all interfaces to rename
4. **Naming Conventions** - Documentation of the new standard

### 4. Git Branching Strategy üåø
- Created branch `i-prefix-interfaces` for this major refactoring
- Recognized this is perfect use case for branches (massive, risky, multi-session work)
- Can now make incremental commits without breaking main

## Technical Decisions

### Extension Architecture
- Extensions are parallel to stdlib, not dependent on it
- Both import from same core packages (@sharpee/core, @sharpee/world-model)
- Extensions should import interfaces from @sharpee/if-domain, not stdlib

### Interface Organization
- Domain interfaces belong in domain packages
- Implementations can be anywhere
- Clear separation enables multiple implementations of same contracts

## Files Created/Modified

### Blood Magic Extension
- `/packages/extensions/blood-magic/src/behaviors/` - Created behavior files
- `/packages/extensions/blood-magic/src/grammar/` - Grammar patterns
- `/packages/extensions/blood-magic/src/actions/` - All action implementations
- `/packages/extensions/blood-magic/tests/` - Complete test suite

### Documentation
- `/docs/architecture/adrs/adr-053-interface-naming-convention.md`
- `/docs/architecture/naming-conventions.md`
- `/docs/work/refactor-interfaces-to-if-domain.md`
- `/docs/work/interface-refactor-checklist.md`

## Next Steps

### Immediate (On Branch)
1. Start Phase 1: Rename all core package interfaces
2. Consider automation scripts for mass renaming
3. Test build after each phase

### Short Term
1. Complete all 6 phases of interface refactoring
2. Move IF interfaces to if-domain package
3. Update blood magic to use new interface names
4. Comprehensive testing before merge

### Long Term
1. Merge i-prefix-interfaces branch after full testing
2. Update all documentation with new conventions
3. Consider major version bump for this breaking change
4. Complete blood magic extension implementation

## Key Insights

1. **Naming Matters**: Interface/class naming conflicts revealed deeper architectural issues
2. **Consistency Over Convention**: Better to have consistent I-prefix everywhere than follow conflicting style guides
3. **Branch for Big Changes**: This refactoring is exactly what branches are for
4. **Extension Architecture**: Clear need for domain interfaces separate from implementations

## Current State
- On branch `i-prefix-interfaces`
- Refactoring plan complete and documented
- Ready to begin Phase 1 (Core package interfaces)
- Blood magic extension awaiting interface refactoring to build properly

## Estimated Work Remaining
- Interface refactoring: 13-20 hours (6-10 with automation)
- Blood magic completion: 2-3 hours after refactoring
- Testing and verification: 2-3 hours
- Documentation updates: 1-2 hours
