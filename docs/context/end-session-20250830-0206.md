# Work Session Summary - ActionContext.sharedData Implementation

## Date: 2025-08-30
## Session Duration: ~45 minutes
## Focus: Implementing ActionContext.sharedData to eliminate context pollution

---

## Major Achievement: ActionContext.sharedData Implemented

### Problem Addressed
The three-phase action pattern had context pollution issues where actions were using `(context as any)._previousLocation` and similar anti-patterns to pass data between the execute and report phases.

### Solution Implemented
Added `sharedData: Record<string, any>` property to ActionContext interface, providing a clean mechanism for passing data between action phases.

---

## Work Completed

### 1. Core Infrastructure (Phase 1)
- **Updated ActionContext Interface** (`packages/stdlib/src/actions/enhanced-types.ts`)
  - Added `sharedData: Record<string, any>` property
  - Added comprehensive JSDoc with examples
  - Shows how to capture context in execute() and use in report()

- **Updated ActionContext Factory** (`packages/engine/src/action-context-factory.ts`)
  - Initialized sharedData as empty object
  - Ensured proper initialization in factory

- **Fixed Compatibility Issues**
  - Updated `ReadOnlyActionContext` class to include sharedData
  - Updated `InternalActionContext` class to include sharedData
  - Fixed sub-context creation to share parent's sharedData

### 2. Taking Action Migration (Phase 2)
**Discovery**: The taking action wasn't actually setting `_previousLocation` or `_implicitlyRemoved` - the context pollution was referenced but never implemented!

**Fixed Implementation**:
```typescript
// In execute() - capture context BEFORE mutations
context.sharedData.previousLocation = context.world.getLocation(noun.id);
context.sharedData.implicitlyRemoved = true;
context.sharedData.wasWorn = true;

// In report() - access captured data
const previousLocation = context.sharedData.previousLocation;
if (context.sharedData.implicitlyRemoved) { /* ... */ }
```

- Updated `taking.ts` to capture context before mutations
- Updated `taking.ts` report method to use sharedData
- Updated `taking-data.ts` to access sharedData
- All taking tests now pass

### 3. Discovery of Other Context Pollution (Phase 3)
Identified 11 actions still using context pollution:

| Action | Fields | Complexity |
|--------|--------|------------|
| opening | `_openResult` | Low |
| closing | `_closeResult` | Low |
| dropping | `_dropResult` | Low |
| putting | `_targetPreposition`, `_putResult` | Medium |
| removing | `_removeResult`, `_takeResult` | Medium |
| entering | `_enteringState` | Medium |
| exiting | `_exitingState` | Medium |
| going | `_isFirstVisit` | Low |
| inserting | `_modifiedContext` | Medium |
| looking | `verboseMode`, `visitedLocations` | Medium |
| attacking | `world.isPeaceful` | Low |

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Created comprehensive core concepts reference at `/docs/reference/core-concepts.md`
- Updated CLAUDE.md to read core concepts on session start
- Updated checklist with all progress marked

## Key Insights

### 1. Context Pollution Was Incomplete
The taking action referenced `_previousLocation` and `_implicitlyRemoved` but never actually set them. This revealed that the context pollution pattern was partially implemented or broken.

### 2. SharedData Is Cleaner
The sharedData approach is much cleaner than context pollution:
- Type-safe (can be typed if needed)
- Explicit about what's being shared
- No TypeScript warnings
- Self-documenting

### 3. Sub-Context Sharing
Sub-contexts created for composite actions need to share the parent's sharedData to maintain data flow across nested action calls.

### 4. Pattern Established
The migration pattern is now clear:
1. Identify what data needs to be captured
2. Capture it in execute() before mutations
3. Store in context.sharedData
4. Access from sharedData in report()

## Files Modified

### Core Changes
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/enhanced-types.ts` - Added sharedData to interface
- `/packages/engine/src/action-context-factory.ts` - Initialize sharedData
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/context.ts` - Added sharedData to deprecated class
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/enhanced-context.ts` - Added sharedData to internal class

### Taking Action Migration
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/taking/taking.ts` - Migrated to sharedData
- `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/taking/taking-data.ts` - Use sharedData

### Documentation
- `/docs/reference/core-concepts.md` - Created comprehensive reference
- `/mnt/c/repotemp/sharpee/CLAUDE.md` - Added instruction to read core concepts
- `/docs/work/stdlib/update-actioncontext-checklist.md` - Updated with progress

---

## Testing Results

### Build Status
✅ All packages build successfully
- stdlib builds without errors
- engine builds without errors

### Test Results
✅ Taking action tests pass
- 20 tests passed
- 1 test skipped
- Golden tests working correctly

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 4)
1. Migrate remaining 11 actions to use sharedData
2. Start with simple actions (opening, closing, dropping)
3. Move to complex actions (putting, removing, entering/exiting)
4. Handle special cases (looking, attacking)

### Future Improvements
1. Consider typing sharedData for each action
2. Add validation for required shared data
3. Document patterns for composite actions
4. Create migration guide for custom actions

---

## Session Summary

Excellent progress implementing ActionContext.sharedData. The solution is cleaner than expected, and discovering that the context pollution was never properly implemented in taking action revealed that this refactor was overdue. The pattern is now established and ready for systematic migration of remaining actions.

The addition of the core concepts reference document will help maintain context across sessions, addressing the frustration of losing fundamental knowledge about the codebase structure.
