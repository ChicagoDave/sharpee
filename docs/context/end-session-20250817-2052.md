# Session Summary - 2025-08-17 20:52

## Session Overview
Continued Phase 3 of I-prefix interface refactoring, successfully committed semantic grammar work, and made significant progress fixing stdlib imports. Reduced build errors from 200+ to 71, with clear path to completion.

## Starting Context
- At commit a135c0c (restored from earlier problematic commits)
- Had uncommitted semantic grammar implementation from previous session
- Phase 1 & 2 complete (core and world-model packages)
- Phase 3 blocked by stdlib using non-I-prefixed interfaces

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Committed Semantic Grammar Work
Successfully committed all semantic grammar implementation in two commits:
- **5b10e0d** - Core semantic grammar infrastructure (ADR-054)
- **230c18e** - Supporting documentation and analysis

### 2. Phase 3 Import Fixes (Partial)
Fixed critical stdlib files to use I-prefixed interfaces:
- **Core context files** - ReadOnlyActionContext, InternalActionContext
- **Enhanced types** - ActionContext interface and related types
- **Meta-action base** - Abstract class for author commands
- **Validation system** - Command validator with IParsedCommand, IValidatedCommand
- **All capability schemas** - 7 capability files updated
- **Query handlers** - Quit and restart handlers
- **Event helpers** - Game event type definitions

### 3. Interface Compatibility Issues Resolved
- Fixed context-adapter to work with actual IParsedCommand structure
- Updated inserting-semantic.ts to access entity names via attributes
- Corrected ValidatedCommand imports to use I-prefixed base

### 4. Created Comprehensive Checklist
Documented all remaining work in `phase-3-remaining-work.md`:
- 71 remaining import errors (all following same pattern)
- Complete list of affected files
- Clear migration path for semantic integration
- Time estimates and testing requirements

## Technical Progress

### Build Error Reduction
```
Initial errors: 200+
After core fixes: 88
Current state: 71
```

### Import Fix Pattern Established
All remaining errors follow predictable patterns:
- `SemanticEvent` → `ISemanticEvent`
- `CloseResult` → `ICloseResult` 
- `DropItemResult` → `IDropItemResult`
- Similar for all other interfaces

### Files Successfully Updated
- 7 capability files
- 5 core action system files
- 2 query handlers
- 3 validation system files
- 1 event helper file

## Issues Discovered

### IParsedCommand Structure
- No `rawText` field (uses `rawInput` instead)
- IParsedObjectReference lacks `determiner` field
- These differences required context-adapter adjustments

### Entity Name Access
- IEntity doesn't have direct `name` property
- Names stored in `attributes.name`
- Required updates to semantic action examples

### ValidatedCommand Extension
- Stdlib extends core IValidatedCommand with scope info
- Import chain: IValidatedCommand → ValidatedCommand (extended)
- This layering is working correctly

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Mechanical)
1. Fix remaining 71 import statements in action files
2. Update any remaining world-model imports
3. Verify stdlib builds successfully

### Integration Work
1. Integrate semantic parser into main parser-en-us
2. Update actions to use semantic properties
3. Remove command modification hacks (INSERTING)

### Testing & Documentation
1. Run full test suite
2. Performance testing of semantic extraction
3. Update migration guides
4. Create PR for branch

## Key Insights

### 1. Systematic Approach Works
The file-by-file approach, while tedious, ensures nothing is missed and all dependencies are properly traced.

### 2. Semantic Grammar Ready
The semantic infrastructure is complete and waiting. Once imports are fixed, the real benefits can be realized.

### 3. Clear Separation Achieved
The I-prefix refactoring successfully separates concerns:
- Core: Pure interfaces (I-prefixed)
- World-model: IF-specific implementations
- Stdlib: Rich implementations with scope
- If-domain: Bridge contracts (includes semantics)

## Session Metrics
- Duration: ~52 minutes
- Files modified: ~25
- Build errors reduced: 129 (from 200 to 71)
- Commits created: 2
- Documentation created: 1 comprehensive checklist

## Summary
Made solid progress on Phase 3, establishing clear patterns and fixing critical files. The remaining work is mechanical but necessary. The semantic grammar infrastructure is proven and ready for integration once the import fixes are complete. The architecture is becoming cleaner with proper interface separation.
