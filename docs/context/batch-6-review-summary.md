# Batch 6 Review Summary (Actions 26-30)

## Overview
Reviewed 5 actions with IF-aware framework. Found one excellent implementation (searching), but four disasters with massive duplication.

## Scores
1. **Restoring**: 2.5/10 - 62-line duplication (35% of file)
2. **Saving**: 2/10 - 49-line duplication + console.log in production!
3. **Scoring**: 1.5/10 - WORST meta-action! 84-line duplication (34% of file)
4. **Searching**: 9/10 - EXCELLENT! Zero duplication, perfect behaviors
5. **Showing**: 3.5/10 - 70-line duplication despite defensive pattern attempt

**Batch Average**: 3.7/10

## Critical Findings

### 1. Console.log in Production
**Saving action line 58**: `console.log('Saving action - sharedData:', sharedData);`
This is unacceptable and suggests no code review.

### 2. Worst Duplication Yet
**Scoring**: 84 lines of verbatim duplication in a 246-line file (34%)
- Entire validate() method is dead code
- Complex rank calculations duplicated
- Progress determination duplicated

### 3. Meta-Action Crisis
All three meta-actions (restoring, saving, scoring) have massive duplication:
- Restoring: 62 lines
- Saving: 49 lines  
- Scoring: 84 lines
- **Total: 195 lines of duplication in critical game features**

### 4. Excellence Exists!
**Searching action proves the team CAN write excellent code**:
- Zero duplication
- Perfect behavior usage
- Clean organization
- Complex logic handled elegantly

### 5. Misunderstood Defensive Pattern
**Showing action** calls validate() in execute() (good!) but then ignores the result and rebuilds everything (bad!)

## Pattern Analysis

### Duplication by Category
- **Meta-actions**: 3 of 3 have severe duplication (100%)
- **Regular actions**: 1 of 2 has severe duplication (50%)
- **Overall**: 4 of 5 have duplication (80%)

### Common Problems
1. **Unused State Interfaces**: 4 of 5 actions define but never use state interfaces
2. **Dead Code in validate()**: All duplicated actions build unused state
3. **Helper Absence**: No helper functions despite obvious need

## Recommendations

### P0 - EMERGENCY
1. Remove console.log from saving action
2. Fix scoring's 84-line duplication
3. Extract helpers for all meta-actions

### P1 - Critical
1. Remove all unused state interfaces
2. Fix showing's misuse of defensive pattern
3. Document searching as exemplar

### P2 - High
1. Create meta-action base class with helpers
2. Add linting rule for console.log
3. Require helper extraction for 20+ line duplications

## Key Insights

### The Searching Paradox
Searching is one of the most complex actions (handles containers, supporters, locations, concealment) yet has the cleanest implementation. This proves complexity doesn't require duplication.

### Meta-Action Pattern Failure  
Meta-actions consistently show the worst duplication. They need a dedicated base class or helper library to prevent this pattern.

### Defensive Pattern Confusion
Developers understand they should re-validate in execute() but don't understand they can USE the validation result instead of rebuilding everything.

## Statistics
- **Total Actions Reviewed**: 30 of 48 (62.5%)
- **Running Average Score**: 5.2/10
- **Actions with Severe Issues**: 18 of 30 (60%)
- **Perfect/Near-Perfect**: 3 of 30 (10%)

## Next Steps
Continue with actions 31-35, watching for:
- More meta-action duplication
- Hidden excellence like searching
- Console.log or other debug code
