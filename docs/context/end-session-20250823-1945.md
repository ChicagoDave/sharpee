# End Session Summary - August 24, 2025

## Session Overview
Completed Phase 3.2 of the atomic events refactor and identified important architectural improvements needed for the action data layer.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Phase 3.2 Complete - Validation Events Include Entity Data ✅
Successfully updated all 10 migrated actions to include entity snapshots in their validation error events:

- **What changed**: Added entity snapshot capture to validation error handling in all action `report()` methods
- **Why it matters**: Validation errors now follow the same atomic pattern as success events
- **Impact**: Error events are self-contained with complete entity data for better error messages

#### Actions Updated:
1. looking - Includes room snapshot on errors
2. examining - Includes target entity snapshot  
3. going - Includes source/destination snapshots
4. taking - Includes item and actor snapshots
5. dropping - Includes item, actor, location snapshots
6. opening - Includes target and contents snapshots
7. closing - Includes target and contents snapshots
8. putting - Includes item and target snapshots
9. inserting - Includes item and container snapshots
10. removing - Includes item, actor, source snapshots

### 2. Identified and Documented Technical Debt

#### ADR-061: Entity Snapshot Code Smell
Recognized that `captureEntitySnapshot` calls throughout action code represent a code smell:
- **Problem**: Repetitive boilerplate in every action
- **Root cause**: Missing abstraction layer for data building
- **Solution**: Defer to action-data pattern from ADR-059

### 3. Created Action Data Refactor Checklist
Developed comprehensive plan to address the snapshot code smell:
- Proposes `-data.ts` companion files for each action
- Centralizes snapshot logic in data builders
- Enables story-specific data extensions
- Maintains clean separation of concerns

## Technical Insights

### Connection Between ADRs
Discovered that three ADRs are interconnected:
- **ADR-058**: Three-phase pattern (validate/execute/report) - IMPLEMENTED
- **ADR-059**: Configurable action data builders - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED  
- **ADR-061**: Snapshot code smell - IDENTIFIED AS TECH DEBT

The snapshot code smell emerged from implementing ADR-058 without the data builder layer proposed in ADR-059.

### Architectural Decisions
- **Decided to defer Phase 4** (Text Service refactor) until action data layer is addressed
- **Recognized need for intermediate abstraction** between actions and event data
- **Prioritized stability** over immediate refactoring

## Files Changed

### Implementation Files (11)
- All 10 action files in `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/*/`
- Added entity snapshot capture to validation error events

### Documentation (4)
- `docs/work/atomic-events-checklist.md` - Marked Phase 3.2 complete
- `docs/work/action-data-refactor-checklist.md` - New comprehensive refactor plan
- `docs/architecture/adr-061-snapshot-code-smell.md` - Documented technical debt
- `docs/context/session-20250823-phase32.md` - Phase 3.2 completion details

## Commit Created
```
feat: Complete Phase 3.2 - Add entity snapshots to validation errors

All 10 actions now include entity snapshots in their validation error events,
ensuring consistency with the atomic events pattern even when validation fails.
```

## Current State of Atomic Events Refactor

### Completed ✅
- Phase 1: Core interfaces updated
- Phase 2: Action architecture redesigned
- Phase 3.1: 10 actions migrated to three-phase pattern
- Phase 3.5: CommandExecutor refactored to thin orchestrator
- Phase 3.2: Validation events include entity snapshots

### Not Yet Started
- Phase 4: Text Service refactor (deferred)
- Phase 5: Story updates
- Phase 6: Engine updates
- Phase 7: Testing & Documentation
- Phase 8: Cleanup

### Technical Debt Identified
- Action data builder pattern needed (ADR-059)
- Snapshot code smell in all actions (ADR-061)
- Test updates needed for new architecture

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority
1. **Implement action data builders** - Address the snapshot code smell
2. **Start with one action** - Validate the pattern works
3. **Migrate remaining actions** - Follow established pattern
4. **Then continue Phase 4** - Text Service refactor

### Strategic Considerations
- The action data refactor will make Phase 4 (Text Service) cleaner
- Story extensions will be easier with data builders in place
- Test writing will be simpler with centralized data logic

## Session Status
**Ready for Next Session**: Code is stable, building successfully, and committed. Clear path forward with action data refactor checklist. The atomic events architecture continues to evolve with better separation of concerns identified.

## Key Takeaways
1. **Pattern recognition is valuable** - Identifying the snapshot code smell prevents accumulating more technical debt
2. **ADRs provide context** - Understanding the relationship between ADR-058, 059, and 061 clarified the path forward
3. **Incremental progress works** - Each phase builds on the previous, revealing architectural improvements
4. **Technical debt is acceptable** - When documented and planned for, temporary solutions enable progress
