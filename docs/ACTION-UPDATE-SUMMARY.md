# Action System Update Summary

## Current State

### What's Been Done
1. **Command Processing Pipeline Updated**
   - Parser now creates `ParsedIFCommand` 
   - New `CommandResolver` converts parsed commands to `ResolvedIFCommand`
   - `ActionExecutor` executes resolved commands
   - Old handlers removed in favor of actions-only approach

2. **Actions Updated to Use ResolvedIFCommand**
   - All actions now use `ResolvedIFCommand` instead of `IFCommand`
   - Entity access simplified: `command.noun` is now a single Entity, not an array
   - Actor is now an Entity object: use `command.actor.id` for the ID

3. **World Model Implemented**
   - Trait-based entity system created
   - Standard traits defined (identity, portable, container, etc.)
   - World model service provides entity management
   - Query builder for complex entity searches

### What Was NOT Done
1. **Actions Still Use Attributes**
   - Actions continue to use `GameContext` interface
   - Entities accessed via `target.attributes.name` not traits
   - This maintains compatibility with existing code

2. **Trait Integration Postponed**
   - The trait-based world model exists but actions don't use it yet
   - Need adapter layer to bridge old and new systems
   - Migration will happen gradually

## Why This Approach?

1. **Stability**: Keep existing functionality working
2. **Compatibility**: No breaking changes to action interface
3. **Incremental**: Can migrate to traits one piece at a time
4. **Testing**: Can verify each step works before proceeding

## Next Steps

### 1. Test Current System
- Verify all actions work with `ResolvedIFCommand`
- Ensure Story class execution pipeline functions correctly
- Test with example games

### 2. Create Adapter Layer (Future)
```typescript
// GameContextAdapter makes WorldModelContext compatible with GameContext
class GameContextAdapter implements GameContext {
  constructor(private worldContext: WorldModelContext) {}
  // ... adapter implementation
}
```

### 3. Migrate Actions Gradually (Future)
- Create trait-aware versions in `/world-model/integration/actions/`
- Test side-by-side with attribute versions
- Switch over once proven stable

### 4. Complete Migration (Future)
- Update action interface to use `WorldModelContext`
- Remove attribute-based code
- Full trait-based system

## Current Usage

```typescript
// Story class now has full pipeline
const story = new Story(config);

// Process input through complete pipeline
const events = await story.processInput("take lamp");

// Or use individual steps
const parsed = story.parseToParsedCommand("take lamp");
const resolved = await story.resolve(parsed);
const events = await story.execute(resolved);
```

## Key Files

- `/execution/command-resolver.ts` - Resolves entities in commands
- `/execution/action-executor.ts` - Executes resolved commands
- `/actions/*.ts` - All updated to use `ResolvedIFCommand`
- `/world-model/` - Trait system (ready but not integrated)

## Benefits of Current Approach

1. **Working System**: Everything functions with existing code
2. **Clear Path**: Know exactly how to migrate to traits
3. **No Risk**: Can always fall back if issues arise
4. **Testable**: Each phase can be thoroughly tested

The system is now ready for testing with the simplified command flow while maintaining compatibility with existing games.
