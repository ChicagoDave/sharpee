# Professional Development Review: Showing Action

## Summary
**Score: 3.5/10** - Significant duplication (70+ lines) despite defensive re-validation attempt

## Critical Issues

### 1. Near-Complete Logic Duplication (70+ lines)
Execute() duplicates nearly ALL validation logic:
- Lines 177-184: Rebuild wearing state (from 74-76)
- Lines 187-194: Rebuild event data (from 108-114)
- Lines 196-198: Rebuild params (from 116-119)
- Lines 203-208: Rebuild identity check (from 125-131)
- Lines 210-228: Rebuild reaction logic (from 134-153)
- Lines 230-232: Rebuild wearing message (from 156-158)

### 2. Defensive Re-validation Pattern
Line 167-175 shows attempt at defensive pattern:
```typescript
const validation = this.validate(context);
if (!validation.valid) {
  return [context.event('action.error', ...)];
}
```
But then rebuilds everything anyway!

### 3. Unused State Interface
`ShowingState` interface defined but never used

### 4. Complex Reaction Logic Duplicated
The viewer reaction logic (lines 134-153 and 210-228) is complex and duplicated, creating high risk of divergence

## IF Pattern Recognition
- **Two-phase pattern**: Acceptable âœ“
- **Defensive re-validation**: Good attempt but poor execution
- **Stateless rebuild**: Over-implemented

## What's Done Right
- Comprehensive scope validation
- Good reaction system design
- Proper event emission
- Rich interaction possibilities

## Recommendations

### P0 - Emergency
Since you're already calling validate(), use its state:
```typescript
execute(context: ActionContext): ISemanticEvent[] {
  const validation = this.validate(context);
  if (!validation.valid) {
    return [/* error */];
  }
  
  // Use validation.state instead of rebuilding!
  const { eventData, messageId, params } = validation.state;
  
  // Just emit events, don't rebuild
}
```

### P1 - Critical
1. Remove unused `ShowingState` interface
2. Extract reaction logic to helper:
```typescript
function determineViewerReaction(
  viewer: IFEntity,
  item: IFEntity
): { messageId: string, flags: ReactionFlags }
```

## Professional Assessment
This action shows a developer who understood the need for defensive validation but implemented it incorrectly. They call validate() in execute() (good!) but then ignore its results and rebuild everything from scratch (bad!).

The 70+ lines of duplication could be eliminated by simply using the validation result. The complex reaction logic is particularly concerning - any bug fix or enhancement must be made in two places.

The irony is that this action is SO CLOSE to being done right. If they just used `validation.state` instead of rebuilding, this would score 7+. Instead, it's another maintenance burden.

This demonstrates a pattern seen across the codebase: developers understanding the requirements but implementing them inefficiently.
