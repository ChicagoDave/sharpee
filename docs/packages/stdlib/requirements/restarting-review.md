# Professional Development Review: Restarting Action

## Summary
**Score: 3/10** - 37-line duplication in a simple meta-action

## Critical Issues

### 1. Significant Code Duplication (37 lines)
Lines 81-113 in execute() duplicate lines 36-70 in validate():
- Game state extraction (36-40 vs 81-85)
- Force restart check (43-45 vs 88-90)
- Restart context building (48-57 vs 93-102)
- Event data construction (61-70 vs 104-113)

### 2. Unused State Interface
`RestartingState` interface defined but never used

### 3. Dead Code in validate()
Lines 61-70 build eventData that validate() can't use or return

### 4. No Defensive Validation
Execute() doesn't call validate() - just duplicates everything

## IF Pattern Recognition
- **Two-phase pattern**: Acceptable for meta-actions ✓
- **Platform events**: Correct usage ✓
- **Stateless execution**: Over-implemented

## What's Done Right
- Proper platform event creation via `createRestartRequestedEvent()`
- Unsaved progress detection
- Force restart handling
- Confirmation logic

## Recommendations

### P0 - Emergency
Extract restart analysis:
```typescript
interface RestartAnalysis {
  restartContext: IRestartContext;
  eventData: RestartRequestedEventData;
  hasUnsavedProgress: boolean;
  forceRestart: boolean;
}

function analyzeRestartRequest(context: ActionContext): RestartAnalysis {
  // All the duplicated logic
}
```

### P1 - Critical
1. Remove unused state interface
2. Remove dead eventData code from validate()
3. Call helper once in execute()

## Professional Assessment
This is yet another meta-action with unnecessary duplication. Restarting is conceptually simple - check for unsaved progress and emit a platform event. Yet it has 37 lines of duplicated logic.

The pattern is consistent with other meta-action failures:
- Builds complex state in validate() that can't be used
- Rebuilds everything in execute()
- Doesn't attempt defensive validation

For a critical operation like restarting, having duplicated logic is particularly dangerous - any bug in the restart logic must be fixed in two places.

This could be a clean 30-line action with proper structure.
