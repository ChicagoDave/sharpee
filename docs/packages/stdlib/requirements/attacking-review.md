# Attacking Action Design - Professional Review

## Executive Summary
The Attacking action attempts to handle both combat and object destruction in a single implementation, resulting in significant complexity and architectural violations. While the trait-based behavior system shows promise, the execution suffers from severe anti-patterns including non-deterministic validation, massive state reconstruction, and inappropriate randomization.

## Critical Failures

### Non-Deterministic Validation
```typescript
// CRITICAL ISSUE: Random number generation in validation
if (targetType === 'actor') {
  const reactions = ['defends', 'dodges', 'retaliates', 'flees'];
  const reaction = reactions[Math.floor(Math.random() * reactions.length)];
}
```
**Severity**: Critical
**Impact**: Validation must be deterministic and pure. Random NPC reactions violate core architectural principles.

### Complete State Reconstruction
```typescript
// In execution:
// Re-validate to ensure consistency
const result = this.validate(context);
if (!result.valid) {
  return [context.event('action.error', ...)];
}
// Rebuild all state from context
```
**Severity**: Critical  
**Impact**: If validation needs repeating, the architecture is fundamentally broken. This indicates zero trust between phases.

### Premature Complexity
The action tries to handle:
- Combat with NPCs
- Object destruction (fragile and breakable)
- Material-specific responses
- Multi-hit mechanics
- Tool requirements
- Strength systems

**Issue**: This violates "do one thing well" and creates unmaintainable complexity.

## Architectural Violations

### Mixing Concerns
The validation phase contains:
1. Target validation
2. Weapon validation
3. Breakability calculations
4. Damage accumulation
5. Material analysis
6. Tool requirement checking

This should be split across validation, behaviors, and specialized handlers.

### State Mutation in Validation
```typescript
// VIOLATION: Modifying trait data during validation
trait.hitsTaken = (trait.hitsTaken || 0) + 1;
if (trait.hitsTaken < trait.hitsToBreak) {
  eventData.partialBreak = true;
}
```
**Issue**: Validation MUST be read-only. State changes belong in execution.

### Missing Behavior Delegation
Unlike the well-designed Closing action that delegates to OpenableBehavior, Attacking implements everything inline, creating:
- 500+ lines of tangled logic
- Untestable code
- No reusability
- Maintenance nightmare

## Design Failures for IF Context

### Breaking IF Principles (Badly)
1. **Randomization in Core Logic**: IF should be deterministic for testing and replay
2. **Combat-First Thinking**: Most IF focuses on puzzles, not combat
3. **Assumed Violence**: No elegant non-violent alternatives built-in

### Over-Engineering
For most IF games, attacking should be simple:
```typescript
// What 90% of IF needs:
if (target.breakable) break();
else "Violence isn't the answer here."
```

Instead, we have strength calculations, material physics, and multi-hit mechanics.

## Positive Elements (Few)

### Trait-Based Differentiation
The concept of using traits (FRAGILE, BREAKABLE) to determine behavior is sound, though poorly executed.

### Verb Variation Awareness
Recognizing different verbs (punch, kick, smash) for varied messages shows attention to player expression.

### Safety Checks
Self-harm prevention and peaceful mode considerations are appropriate.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Critical Fixes

#### 1. Remove ALL Randomization from Validation
```typescript
validate(context: ActionContext): ValidationResult {
  // ONLY check if action CAN happen
  // NO random numbers, NO state changes
  const target = context.command.directObject?.entity;
  if (!target) return { valid: false, error: 'no_target' };
  
  // Check reachability, visibility, etc.
  // Return validation result with state for execute
  return { 
    valid: true,
    state: { targetType, isFragile, isBreakable }
  };
}
```

#### 2. Extract Behaviors
Create specialized behaviors:
- `CombatBehavior.attack(attacker, target, weapon?)`
- `BreakableBehavior.damage(target, force)`
- `FragileBehavior.shatter(target)`

#### 3. Implement Three-Phase Pattern
```typescript
validate(): ValidationResult
execute(): void  // Delegate to behaviors
report(): ISemanticEvent[]  // Generate events
```

### Long-term Refactoring

#### Split into Multiple Actions
Consider:
- `AttackingAction` - NPC combat only
- `BreakingAction` - Object destruction
- `SmashingAction` - Force-based breaking

#### Create Combat System Module
If combat is needed, build a proper system:
```typescript
interface CombatSystem {
  resolve(attacker, defender, weapon?): CombatResult
  applyDamage(target, amount): void
  checkDefense(defender): Defense
}
```

## Comparison with Well-Designed Actions

### Versus Closing Action
| Aspect | Closing | Attacking |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Lines of Code | ~100 | 500+ |
| Behavior Delegation | ✓ | ✗ |
| State Purity | ✓ | ✗ |
| Single Responsibility | ✓ | ✗ |
| Testability | High | Low |

### Versus About Action
About demonstrates minimalism; Attacking demonstrates what happens without restraint.

## Testing Nightmares

### Current Impossibilities
1. **Non-Deterministic**: Random reactions make testing unreliable
2. **State Dependencies**: Can't test validation in isolation
3. **Multi-Path Complexity**: Dozens of execution paths
4. **Side Effects**: State mutations during validation

### Required Test Scenarios
With current design, you'd need tests for:
- 3 target types × 8 verbs × 2 weapon states × 5 materials × 3 strength levels = 720 combinations

## IF-Specific Concerns

### Violence in IF
Most modern IF de-emphasizes combat because:
1. Text doesn't handle real-time combat well
2. Players expect puzzle-solving, not fighting
3. Violence limits narrative options

This action's combat focus seems misaligned with IF trends.

### Missing IF Patterns
- No "instead of attacking" rules
- No peaceful resolution paths
- No conversation alternatives
- No puzzle-based solutions

## Performance Issues

### Validation Overhead
Multiple trait checks, repeated gets, and complex calculations in hot path.

### Memory Leaks
Event data structures are huge and include unnecessary snapshots.

### Event Spam
Generates too many events for simple actions.

## Security & Stability

### Race Conditions
State changes between validation and execution could cause inconsistencies.

### Infinite Loops
Multi-hit mechanics with no upper bound could cause problems.

### Memory Exhaustion
Fragment generation without limits is dangerous.

## Risk Assessment
**Risk Level**: High
- Non-deterministic behavior
- Architectural violations
- High complexity
- Poor testability
- Maintenance burden

## Conclusion
The Attacking action is a cautionary tale of unchecked complexity and architectural violations. It needs complete redesign, not incremental fixes. The current implementation should be considered technical debt requiring immediate attention.

## Score
**3/10**

Points earned for:
- Trait concept (+1)
- Safety checks (+1)
- Comprehensive documentation (+1)

Points lost for:
- Non-deterministic validation (-3)
- State reconstruction anti-pattern (-2)
- Missing behavior delegation (-1)
- Excessive complexity (-1)

## Priority Actions

### Phase 1: Stabilization (Critical)
1. Remove ALL randomization from validation
2. Eliminate state reconstruction in execute
3. Extract state mutations to execution phase

### Phase 2: Refactoring (High)
1. Create behavior classes
2. Implement three-phase pattern
3. Reduce complexity by 70%

### Phase 3: Redesign (Medium)
1. Split into separate actions
2. Build proper combat module if needed
3. Add peaceful alternatives

## Anti-Patterns Demonstrated
1. **Kitchen Sink**: Trying to do everything
2. **Validation Impurity**: State changes and randomization
3. **Distrust Pattern**: Re-validating in execute
4. **Inline Everything**: No delegation or separation
5. **Complexity Creep**: 500+ lines for basic action

## Lessons for Team
1. **Simplicity First**: Start minimal, extend carefully
2. **Delegate Complex Logic**: Use behavior classes
3. **Maintain Phase Purity**: Validation must be deterministic
4. **Question Requirements**: Does IF really need combat?
5. **Test-Driven Design**: Untestable code is bad code

This action needs complete rewrite, not review. Consider deprecating current implementation and starting fresh with clear, limited scope.
