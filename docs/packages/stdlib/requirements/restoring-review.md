# Professional Development Review: Restoring Action

## Summary
**Score: 2.5/10** - Catastrophic 62-line verbatim duplication between validate() and execute()

## Critical Issues

### 1. MASSIVE Code Duplication (62 lines)
Lines 69-92 in validate() are EXACTLY duplicated in lines 129-143 in execute():
```typescript
// Building available saves info - EXACT duplication
const availableSaves = Object.entries(existingSaves).map(([slot, data]: [string, any]) => ({
  slot,
  name: data.name || slot,
  timestamp: data.timestamp || Date.now(),
  metadata: {
    score: data.score,
    moves: data.moves,
    version: data.version
  }
}));

// Find last save info - EXACT duplication
const lastSave = availableSaves.reduce((latest, save) => 
  !latest || save.timestamp > latest.timestamp ? save : latest
, null as any);
```

### 2. RestoreContext Built Twice
Lines 94-101 in validate() duplicated at lines 146-153 in execute()

### 3. Unused State Interface
`RestoringState` interface defined but never used (should be removed)

### 4. Dead Code in validate()
Lines 105-109 build eventData that's never used - validate() doesn't emit events!

## IF Pattern Recognition
- **Two-phase pattern**: Acceptable for meta-actions ✓
- **Stateless execution**: Required for save/restore ✓
- **Platform events**: Correct usage ✓

## Correct Implementation Elements
- Proper platform event creation via `createRestoreRequestedEvent()`
- Good save slot extraction logic
- Appropriate error messages

## Recommendations

### P0 - Emergency
Extract helper function for duplicated logic:
```typescript
function buildRestoreContext(existingSaves: any): {
  availableSaves: SaveInfo[],
  lastSave: SaveInfo | null,
  restoreContext: IRestoreContext
} {
  // Build once, use twice
}
```

### P1 - Critical
1. Remove unused `RestoringState` interface
2. Remove dead eventData code from validate()
3. Use consistent variable names (saveName vs slot)

## Professional Assessment
This is a meta-action handling critical game state operations with unacceptable code duplication. The 62-line verbatim duplication represents ~35% of the file and creates severe maintenance risk. Any bug fix or enhancement must be made in two places, doubling the chance of errors in save/restore functionality - a critical game feature.

The duplication is particularly egregious because:
1. It's in a critical path (save/restore)
2. It involves complex data transformation
3. The logic could easily diverge accidentally

This needs emergency refactoring before any other work on save/restore features.
