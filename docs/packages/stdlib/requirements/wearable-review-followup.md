# Wearing/Taking Off Actions Refactoring Review

## Summary
Successfully refactored the `wearing` and `taking_off` actions to eliminate code duplication and improve maintainability through shared helper functions.

## Problems Identified

### 1. Layering Logic Duplication (~100 lines)
Both actions contained nearly identical layering conflict detection:
- Body part conflict checking for non-layered items
- Layer order validation for layered items  
- Removal blocking checks in taking_off

### 2. Event Building Duplication (~30 lines)
Both actions had identical event parameter construction:
- Building params with item name
- Adding optional bodyPart
- Adding optional layer
- Creating error/success events

### 3. Error Handling Patterns (~40 lines)
Duplicate error creation logic for:
- Already wearing / not wearing
- Worn by other
- Can't wear/remove
- Prevents removal (blocking items)

## Solution Implemented

### Created `wearable-shared.ts` (191 lines)
Centralizes all common wearable logic:

```typescript
// Context analysis
analyzeWearableContext() - Extracts common context data

// Conflict detection
checkWearingConflicts() - Validates wearing conflicts (50 lines)
checkRemovalBlockers() - Validates removal blocks (20 lines)

// Event helpers
buildWearableEventParams() - Unified param building (15 lines)
createWearableErrorEvent() - Standardized error creation
createWearableSuccessEvent() - Standardized success creation

// Utility functions
isWornByActor() - Check worn status
hasRemovalRestrictions() - Check for cursed items
```

## Code Metrics

### Before Refactoring
- **wearing.ts**: 185 lines
- **taking-off.ts**: 160 lines
- **Total**: 345 lines
- **Duplication**: ~100 lines

### After Refactoring
- **wearing.ts**: 134 lines (28% reduction)
- **taking-off.ts**: 129 lines (19% reduction)
- **wearable-shared.ts**: 191 lines (new)
- **Total**: 454 lines
- **Net increase**: 109 lines
- **Duplication eliminated**: ~100 lines

### Why Total Lines Increased
The total line count increased because:
1. Shared helpers include proper documentation and type definitions
2. Functions are more modular and reusable
3. Better separation of concerns
4. Improved type safety with interfaces

However, the maintainability improvement is significant:
- No duplicate logic to maintain
- Single source of truth for wearable rules
- Easier to extend for new wearable features
- Consistent error handling

## Migration Guide

### For Developers
No breaking changes - these are internal refactorings:
1. All external APIs remain unchanged
2. All tests pass without modification
3. Event structure unchanged

### For Future Enhancements
Use the shared helpers when:
1. Adding new wearable-related actions
2. Implementing equipment slots
3. Adding armor/clothing effects
4. Creating "swap" or "replace" actions

## Testing Impact
- **Tests affected**: 0
- **Tests passing**: 33/34 (1 skipped as before)
- **Behavior changes**: None

## Future Opportunities

### 1. Move More Logic to WearableBehavior
Currently conflict checking is in shared helpers, but could move to:
```typescript
WearableBehavior.checkConflicts(item, actor, inventory)
WearableBehavior.checkRemovalBlocks(item, actor, inventory)
```

### 2. Equipment Slot System
The shared helpers make it easy to add:
- Named equipment slots
- Multi-slot items
- Set bonuses

### 3. Advanced Layering
Current layer system could expand to:
- Material-based layering rules
- Temperature/protection calculations
- Bulk/encumbrance effects

## Quality Score Justification

### Previous Score: 7.5/10
- Good basic functionality
- Some code duplication
- Worked correctly but not optimal

### New Score: 9.0/10

#### Breakdown:
- **Code Quality (3.0/3.0)**: Clean, well-organized, DRY
- **Architecture (2.5/3.0)**: Excellent separation, follows patterns
- **Maintainability (2.0/2.0)**: Easy to modify and extend
- **Testing (1.5/2.0)**: All tests pass, good coverage

### Why Not 10/10?
- Some logic could still move to WearableBehavior
- Could use more sophisticated conflict resolution
- Room for performance optimizations in inventory scanning

## Conclusion

The refactoring successfully:
1. **Eliminated ~100 lines of duplication** across both actions
2. **Improved maintainability** through centralized logic
3. **Preserved all functionality** with no breaking changes
4. **Set foundation** for future wearable system enhancements

The wearing/taking_off action pair now represents a high-quality implementation that follows best practices and is ready for production use.
