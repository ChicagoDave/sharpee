# Professional Development Review: Exiting Action (IF-Aware)

## Summary
**Component**: `packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/exiting/exiting.ts`  
**Purpose**: Exit from containers, supporters, or other enterable objects  
**Verdict**: NEEDS IMPROVEMENT - IF patterns partially acceptable, real issues remain  
**Score**: 4.5/10  

## IF Pattern Context

### 1. Execute Returns Events (Line 98)
```typescript
execute(context: ActionContext): ISemanticEvent[]
```
**Standard Expectation**: Three-phase with report()  
**IF Assessment**: ✅ ACCEPTABLE - Two-phase pattern valid for IF narrative flow  
**Note**: While three-phase (like going.ts) would be better, this is legitimate  

### 2. State Reconstruction (Lines 99-108)
```typescript
execute(context: ActionContext): ISemanticEvent[] {
    // Re-validates during execute
    const validation = this.validate(context);
    if (!validation.valid) {
      return [context.event('action.error', {...})];
    }
```
**IF Assessment**: ⚠️ QUESTIONABLE even for IF  
**Issue**: While IF might not guarantee validate() is called, this is defensive to a fault  
**Better**: Trust framework or document why re-validation needed  

### 3. Manual State Mutation (Lines 126-134)
```typescript
// Comment admits bypassing behavior
// Note: EntryBehavior.exit() returns events but we generate our own
// So we manually update the occupants
const index = entryTrait.occupants?.indexOf(actor.id);
if (index !== undefined && index >= 0) {
  entryTrait.occupants!.splice(index, 1);
}
```
**IF Assessment**: ❌ BAD in any paradigm  
**Issue**: Developer KNOWS about EntryBehavior.exit() but bypasses it  
**Impact**: Violates encapsulation, prone to bugs  

## What's Actually Wrong (IF-Aware)

### Real Issues (Not IF-Related)
1. **Manual array manipulation** instead of behavior usage
2. **Admitted architectural bypass** (line 127 comment)
3. **Re-validation overhead** even if defensive
4. **No helper functions** for complex logic

### IF-Acceptable Patterns
1. ✅ Execute returning events (two-phase pattern)
2. ✅ Event generation for narrative
3. ✅ Defensive validation (though excessive)

### Comparison with Excellence
```typescript
// Going.ts (9.5/10) - ideal IF pattern
validate(): ValidationResult { /* validation */ }
execute(): void { /* mutations only */ }
report(): ISemanticEvent[] { /* events */ }

// Exiting.ts - acceptable but not ideal
validate(): ValidationResult { /* validation */ }
execute(): ISemanticEvent[] { /* re-validates, mutates, returns events */ }
// No report()
```

## Quality Metrics (IF-Adjusted)

### Architecture: D+
- Two-phase pattern is acceptable for IF
- Manual mutations are not acceptable
- Re-validation is wasteful but defensive

### Maintainability: D
- Bypassing behaviors creates debt
- Comment shows awareness of wrong approach
- Missing helper functions

### IF Compliance: C+
- Event generation pattern acceptable
- Narrative flow maintained
- But implementation has issues

## Required Improvements

### Priority 1: Fix Behavior Bypass
```typescript
// WRONG: Manual mutation
entryTrait.occupants!.splice(index, 1);

// RIGHT: Use behavior
const exitResult = EntryBehavior.exit(currentContainer, actor.id);
// Handle or merge events as needed
```

### Priority 2: Consider Three-Phase
```typescript
// Better pattern (like going.ts)
execute(context): void {
    // Just mutations via behaviors
    EntryBehavior.exit(currentContainer, actor.id);
    context.world.moveEntity(actor.id, parentLocation);
}

report(context): ISemanticEvent[] {
    // Generate events here
    return events;
}
```

### Priority 3: Document Defensive Choices
```typescript
execute(context) {
    // IF PATTERN: Re-validate defensively since framework
    // doesn't guarantee validate() was called in all paths
    const validation = this.validate(context);
}
```

## Business Impact

### Development Assessment
- **Current state**: Functional but problematic
- **Fix effort**: 6-8 hours
- **Risk**: Medium - behavior bypass could cause bugs

### Technical Debt
- Manual mutations (high priority)
- Pattern inconsistency (medium priority)
- Missing documentation (low priority)

## Review Summary (IF-Aware)

With IF platform context, the exiting action's two-phase pattern is acceptable. The real issues are:
1. **Manual state mutations** bypassing EntryBehavior
2. **Developer awareness** of correct approach but choosing wrong one
3. **Lack of helpers** for complex logic

The score improves from 2/10 to 4.5/10 with IF awareness, but significant issues remain that aren't excused by IF patterns.

**Recommendation**: REFACTOR BEHAVIOR USAGE  
**Estimated fix time**: 8 hours  
**Priority**: MEDIUM-HIGH (behavior bypass is risky)

## Lessons for Team

1. IF patterns allow two-phase but three-phase is better
2. Never bypass behaviors even if their events don't fit
3. Document IF-specific defensive patterns
4. Manual state mutation is wrong in any paradigm
5. If you write "Note: X returns events but we do Y instead" - reconsider
