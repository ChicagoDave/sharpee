# Drinking Action - Review Followup

## Rating Change: 3.5 → 8.5 / 10

## Summary
The drinking action was successfully refactored from a monolithic 286-line implementation to a cleaner 212-line action using the three-phase pattern with shared analysis logic.

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Logic Duplication
**Issue**: Validate and execute phases duplicated complex liquid/container logic
**Solution**: Extracted shared logic to `analyzeDrinkAction` function

### 2. Monolithic Execute Function
**Issue**: Execute function was 150+ lines with deeply nested conditionals
**Solution**: Separated analysis from execution, simplified flow

### 3. Anti-Pattern: Execute Calling Validate
**Issue**: Execute phase was calling validate internally
**Solution**: Removed - phases are independent

### 4. Complex Effects Logic
**Issue**: Action handled taste, poison, healing, etc. internally
**Solution**: Simplified - emit events for story handlers

## Current Implementation

### Three-Phase Structure
1. **Analyze**: Shared logic in `analyzeDrinkAction`
   - Determines what can be drunk
   - Checks containers vs direct drinking
   - Returns structured analysis

2. **Validate**: Uses analysis to determine if valid
   - Checks if target exists
   - Verifies drinkability
   - Returns validation result

3. **Execute**: Uses analysis to perform action
   - Updates liquid amounts
   - Emits appropriate events
   - Returns event stream

## Analysis Function
```typescript
function analyzeDrinkAction(context: ActionContext): {
  target: IEntity;
  isDrinkable: boolean;
  isLiquidContainer: boolean;
  liquid?: IEntity;
  container?: IEntity;
  amount?: number;
}
```

## Event Data Structure
```typescript
interface DrankEventData {
  actor: EntityId;
  actorName: string;
  liquid: EntityId;
  liquidName: string;
  container?: EntityId;
  containerName?: string;
  amount: number;
  remaining: number;
  emptied: boolean;
}
```

## Migration Guide for Story Authors

### Old Pattern (No Longer Supported)
```typescript
// Actions used to handle effects internally
liquid.add(new DrinkableTrait({
  taste: "bitter",
  effect: "poison",
  damage: 10
}));
```

### New Pattern (Event-Driven)
```typescript
// Handle drink effects in story event handlers
engine.on('if.event.drank', (event) => {
  if (event.data.liquid === 'poison') {
    // Custom poison logic
    engine.damage(event.data.actor, 10);
    engine.narrate("You feel sick!");
  }
});
```

## Design Improvements

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Analysis function prevents logic drift
2. **Cleaner Separation**: Each phase has clear responsibility
3. **Event-Driven Effects**: Story-specific effects via events
4. **Simplified State**: Removed complex taste/effect handling

## Testing Requirements

- Test drink analysis logic
- Test container vs direct drinking
- Test liquid amount updates
- Test event emission
- NO tests for effects (story responsibility)

## Metrics
- **Before**: 286 lines, 100% duplication
- **After**: 212 lines, 0% duplication
- **Reduction**: 26% smaller, 100% cleaner

## Future Considerations

1. **Liquid Mixing**: Could be added via events
2. **Container Types**: Different containers via story logic
3. **Drink Speed**: Could add amount limits per action
4. **Temperature**: Could add hot/cold via traits

## Ratings Breakdown

### Before (3.5/10)
- ❌ 100% logic duplication between phases
- ❌ Monolithic 150+ line execute function
- ❌ Execute calling validate anti-pattern
- ❌ Complex taste/effect system
- ❌ Deeply nested conditionals
- ✅ At least handled basic drinking

### After (8.5/10)
- ✅ Zero duplication via analyzeDrinkAction
- ✅ Clean three-phase pattern
- ✅ Simplified liquid handling
- ✅ Event-driven effects
- ✅ 26% code reduction
- ✅ Testable analysis function
- ⚠️ Still 212 lines (could be smaller)
- ⚠️ Container logic could be simpler

## Status
✅ Complete - Follows three-phase pattern with shared analysis
