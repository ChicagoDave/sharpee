# Pushing Action - Review Followup

## Rating Change: 3.0 → 8.5 / 10

## Summary
The pushing action was successfully refactored from a 406-line implementation with ~190 lines of near-duplication to a clean 250-line action using shared analysis logic.

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Near-Duplication with Logic Divergence
**Issue**: ~190 lines of near-duplicate code between validate and execute
**Solution**: Extracted shared logic to `analyzePushAction` function

### 2. Complex Switch Statements Duplicated
**Issue**: Identical switch statements for button/heavy/moveable types in both phases
**Solution**: Single analysis function determines push outcome

### 3. Message Building Duplication
**Issue**: Message parameter logic repeated in both phases
**Solution**: Centralized in analysis function

### 4. Inconsistent State Handling
**Issue**: Different message IDs used in validate vs execute
**Solution**: Single source of truth for messages

## Current Implementation

### Analysis Function
```typescript
function analyzePushAction(context: ActionContext): PushAnalysis | null {
  // Determines push type (button/heavy/moveable)
  // Builds event data
  // Selects appropriate message
  // Returns unified analysis
}
```

### Validate Phase
- Checks for target existence
- Verifies not wearing item
- Checks pushability
- Delegates complex logic to analysis

### Execute Phase
- Calls analysis function
- Emits push event
- Returns success message

## Event Data Structure
```typescript
interface PushedEventData {
  target: EntityId;
  targetName: string;
  direction?: string;
  pushType?: 'button' | 'heavy' | 'moveable';
  activated?: boolean;
  moved?: boolean;
  nudged?: boolean;
  revealsPassage?: boolean;
  sound?: string;
}
```

## Migration Guide for Story Authors

No migration needed - push action interface unchanged. The refactoring is internal only.

## Design Improvements

1. **Single Analysis Point**: All push logic in one place
2. **No Duplication**: Reduced from ~190 to 0 duplicate lines
3. **Clear Separation**: Validate checks possibility, execute performs
4. **Maintainable**: Changes only needed in one place

## Metrics
- **Before**: 406 lines with ~190 near-duplication
- **After**: 250 lines with 0 duplication
- **Reduction**: 38% smaller, 100% duplication eliminated

## Ratings Breakdown

### Before (3.0/10)
- ❌ ~190 lines near-duplication
- ❌ Complex switch statements repeated
- ❌ Message logic duplicated
- ❌ Maintenance nightmare with divergent logic
- ✅ At least handled basic pushing

### After (8.5/10)
- ✅ Zero duplication via analyzePushAction
- ✅ Single switch statement
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ 38% code reduction
- ✅ Maintainable and extensible
- ⚠️ Could be even smaller
- ⚠️ Analysis function could be split further

## Future Enhancements

1. **Strength System**: Add player strength checks for heavy objects
2. **Multi-Direction**: Support diagonal pushing
3. **Push Chains**: Objects pushing other objects
4. **Sound Effects**: Richer audio feedback

## Status
✅ Complete - Near-duplication eliminated, clean architecture achieved
