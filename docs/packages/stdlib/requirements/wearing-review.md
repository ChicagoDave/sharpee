# Professional Development Review: Wearing Action

## Summary
**Score: 7.5/10** - Good two-phase with behavior delegation, but validation logic in execute()

## Strengths

### 1. Good Behavior Delegation ✓
- Uses `WearableBehavior.canWear()` for validation
- Uses `WearableBehavior.wear()` for state change
- Never manually manipulates worn state

### 2. Clean Two-Phase Pattern ✓
- validate(): Basic permission checks
- execute(): State change with defensive checks

### 3. Sophisticated Layering System ✓
Lines 74-119: Complex layering and body part conflict detection

### 4. Implicit Action Handling ✓
Lines 63-70: Handles implicit taking if item not held

### 5. Zero Logic Duplication ✓
No duplication between validate() and execute()

## Issues

### 1. Validation Logic in Execute
Lines 74-119: Extensive validation logic (layering, conflicts) happens in execute() not validate()
This violates the principle that validate() determines IF action can happen

### 2. TODO Comment
Line 73: `// TODO: Move conflict checking into WearableBehavior`
Shows awareness of the issue but not fixed

### 3. Type Safety
Some `as any` casts could be improved

## IF Pattern Recognition
- **Two-phase pattern**: Good implementation ✓
- **Behavior delegation**: Mostly good ✓
- **Defensive execution**: Properly implemented ✓

## What's Done Right
- Implicit taking when item is reachable but not held
- Comprehensive layering rules
- Body part conflict detection
- Clean error messages

## Recommendations

### P1 - Important
Move ALL validation logic from execute() to validate():
1. Conflict checking (lines 74-97)
2. Layering rules (lines 99-119)

These determine if wearing is POSSIBLE, not how to do it.

### P2 - Nice to Have
1. Complete the TODO - move conflict checking to WearableBehavior
2. Improve type safety

## Professional Assessment
This is a well-structured action with good behavior delegation and sophisticated clothing mechanics. The layering system is particularly impressive.

The main architectural issue is that significant validation logic (45+ lines) lives in execute() when it should be in validate(). This violates separation of concerns - validate() should determine IF wearing is possible (including all conflicts and layering), while execute() should just perform it.

The TODO comment shows the developer knew this was wrong but didn't fix it. With the validation logic properly placed, this would be an 8.5/10.
