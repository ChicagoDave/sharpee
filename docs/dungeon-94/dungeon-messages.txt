1 User Commands

The following command may probe useful while playing Dungeon.
They are not, however, game commands; that is, they have no side
affects on the current game.

1.1 Verbosity

    VERBOSE: The default: prints long room descriptions on first
  visit, 20% of the time thereafter.

    BRIEF: Prints short room descriptions and short object
  descriptions for rooms which have been visited.

    SUPERBRIEF: Prints short room descriptions and short object
  descriptions all the time, even on the first visit.

Note that the maximally verbose description may always be obtained
by the command "LOOK".  See also the "ROOM" and "OBJECTS" commands.

1.2 Help

    INFO: Prints information on what the game is about.

    HELP: Prints this message.

1.3 Progress

    QUIT: Prints your score, and asks whether you wish to
  continue playing; "Q" is equivalent.

    SCORE: Prints your score (and deflates your ego).

    TIME: Prints how much time you have wasted playing the game.

    VERSION: Prints the current version number.

1.4 Save/Restore

    SAVE: Saves the current game for future continuation.

    RESTORE: Restores a previous saved game.

SAVE and RESTORE take an optional file name, in quotation marks.  If
no name is given, the file name defaults to "DSAVE.DAT".

1.5 General

    AGAIN: Repeats the last command.

    LOOK: Describes the current surroundings; "L" is equivalent.

    ROOM: Prints the verbose description of the current room,
  without object descriptions.

    RNAME: Prints the short description of the current room.

    OBJECTS: Prints the verbose description of all the objects
  in the current room, without describing the room.

    INVENTORY: Prints a list of your possessions; "I" is equivalent.

    DIAGNOSE: Prints your current state of health.

    WAIT: Causes "time" to pass.

2 Command parser

A command is one line of text terminated by a carriage return.
For reasons of simplicity, all words are distinguished by their
first eight letters.  All others are ignored.  For example, typing
"DISASSEMBLE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA" is not only meaningless, it also
creates excess effort for your fingers.  Note that this trunca-
tion may produce ambiguities in the intepretation of long words.

You are talking to a moderately stupid parser, which understands
the following types of things:

2.1 Actions

    Among the more obvious of these, TAKE, PUT, DROP, etc.  Fairly
    general forms of these may be used, such as PICK UP, PUT DOWN, etc.

2.2 Directions

    NORTH, SOUTH, UP, DOWN, etc. and their various abbreviations.
    Other more obscure directions (LAND, CROSS) are appropriate in
    only certain situations.

2.3 Objects

    Most objects have names and can be referenced by them.  Multiple
    objects, separated by commas or AND, can be used with TAKE, PUT,
    and DROP.  In addition, there are collective objects EVERYTHING,
    VALUABLES, and POSSESSIONS, which may also be used with TAKE
    PUT, and DROP.  Collective objects may be qualified with an
    EXCEPT clause; for example, TAKE EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE RUG.

2.4 Adjectives

    Some adjectives are understood and required when there are
    two objects which can be referenced with the same noun (e.g.,
    DOORs, BUTTONs).

2.5 Prepositions

    It may be necessary in some cases to include prepositions, but
    the parser attempts to handle cases which aren't ambiguous
    without.  Thus "GIVE CAR TO DEMON" will work, as will "GIVE DEMON
    CAR".  When a preposition is used, it should be appropriate;
    "GIVE CAR WITH DEMON" won't parse.

2.6 Sentences

    The parser understands a reasonable number of things.  For example,
    multiple commands (separated by periods or semicolons) can be placed
    on the same line.

2.7 Ambiguity

    The parser tries to be clever about what to do in the case of
    actions which require objects that are not explicitly specified.
    If there is only one possible object, the parser will assume
    that it should be used.  Otherwise, the parser will ask.
    Most questions asked by the parser can be answered.

3 Theories

The following "theories" are fundamental to the game and should be noted.

3.1 Containment

    Some objects can contain other objects.  Many such containers can
    be opened and closed.  The rest are always open.   They may or may
    not be transparent.  For you to access (e.g., take) an object
    which is in a container, the container must be open.  For you
    to see such an object, the container must be either open or
    transparent.  Containers have a capacity, and objects have sizes;
    the number of objects which will fit therefore depends on their
    sizes.  You may put any object you have access to (it need not be
    in your hands) into any other object.  At some point, the program
    will attempt to pick it up if you don't already have it, which
    process may fail if you're carrying too much.  Although containers
    can contain other containers, the program doesn't access more than
    one level down.

3.2 Fighting

    Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when
    attacked.  In some cases, they may attack even if unprovoked.
    Useful verbs here are "ATTACK <villain> WITH <weapon>", "KILL",
    etc.  Knife-throwing may or may not be useful.  You have a
    fighting strength which varies with time.  Being in a fight,
    getting killed, and being injured all lower this strength.
    Strength is regained with time.  Thus, it is not a good idea to
    fight someone immediately after being killed.  Other details
    should become apparent after a few melees or deaths.  The
    "DIAGNOSE" command describes your state of health.

3.3 Vehicles

    These are some objects in the labyrinth which are rumored to have
    the ability to transport the fearless adventurer to mysterious
    regions which are inaccessible on foot.  Needless to say, the
    adventurer faces great personal peril as he encounters these
    regions.  The vehicles can usually be entered with the "BOARD"
    command and can be exited with the "DISEMBARK" command.

[5]
Welcome to Dungeon!

   You are near a large dungeon, which is reputed to contain vast
quantities of treasure.   Naturally, you wish to acquire some of it.
In order to do so, you must of course remove it from the dungeon.  To
receive full credit for it, you must deposit it safely in the trophy
case in the living room of the house.

   In addition to valuables, the dungeon contains various objects
which may or may not be useful in your attempt to get rich.  You may
need sources of light, since dungeons are often dark, and weapons,
since dungeons often have unfriendly things wandering about.  Reading
material is scattered around the dungeon as well;  some of it
is rumored to be useful.

   To determine how successful you have been, a score is kept.
When you find a valuable object and pick it up, you receive a
certain number of points, which depends on the difficulty of finding
the object.  You receive extra points for transporting the treasure
safely to the living room and placing it in the trophy case.  In
addition, some particularly interesting rooms have a value associated
with visiting them.  The only penalty is for getting yourself killed,
which you may do only twice.

   Of special note is a thief (always carrying a large bag) who likes
to wander around in the dungeon (he has never been seen by the light
of day).  He likes to take things.  Since he steals for pleasure
rather than profit and is somewhat sadistic, he only takes things which
you have seen.  Although he prefers valuables, sometimes in his haste
he may take something which is worthless.  From time to time, he examines
his take and discards objects which he doesn't like.  He may occas-
ionally stop in a room you are visiting, but more often he just wanders
through and rips you off (he is a skilled pickpocket).

[6]
Please answer the question.

[7]
You clearly are a suicidal maniac.  We don't allow psychotics in the
dungeon, since they may harm other adventurers.  Your remains will be
installed in the Land of the Living Dead, where your fellow adventurers
may gloat over them.

[8]
As you take your last breath, you feel relieved of your burdens.  The
feeling passes as you find yourself before the gates of Hell, where
the spirits jeer at you and deny you entry.  Your senses are disturbed.
The objects in the dungeon appear indistinct, bleached of color, even
unreal.

[9]
From the distance the sound of a lone trumpet is heard.  The room
becomes very bright, and you feel disembodied.  In a momemt, the
brightness fades, and you find yourself rising, as if from a long
sleep, deep in the woods.  In the distance you can faintly hear a
song bird and the sounds of the forest.

[10]
Ok.

[11]
You are behind the white house.  In one corner of the house
there is a small window which is #.

[12]
open

[13]
slightly ajar

[14]
This is the kitchen of the white house.  A table seems to have been
used recently for the preparation of food.  A passage leads to the
west, and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward.  To the east
is a small window which is #.

[15]
This is the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west
is a wooden door with strange gothic lettering, which appears to be
nailed shut.

[16]
This is the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west
is a cyclops-shaped hole in an old wooden door, above which is some
strange gothic lettering.

[17]
In the center of the room is a large oriental rug.

[18]
In the center of the room is a closed trap door.

[19]
In the center of the room is an open trap door.

[20]
There is a rug lying next to an open trap door.

[21]
This is a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading
east, and a crawlway to the south.  To the west is the bottom of
a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.

[22]
The door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.

[23]
This is a small room near the maze.  There are twisty
passages in the immediate vicinity.

[24]
Above you is a grating locked with a skull-and-crossbones lock.

[25]
Above you is an open grating with sunlight pouring in.

[26]
Above you is a grating.

[27]
This is a clearing, with a forest to the west and south.

[28]
There is a grating securely fastened into the ground.

[29]
There is an open grating descending into darkness.

[30]
A grating appears on the ground.

[31]
This is a long room on the south shore of a large reservoir.

[32]
This is a long room, to the north of which was formerly a reservoir.
However, with the water level lowered, there is merely a wide stream
running through the center of the room.

[33]
There is a western exit, a passageway south, and a steep pathway
climbing up along the edge of a cliff.

[34]
You are on the reservoir.  Beaches can be seen north and south.
Upstream a small stream enters the reservoir through a narrow
cleft in the rocks.  The dam can be seen downstream.

[35]
You are on what used to be a large reservoir, but which is now a
large mud pile.  There are "shores" to the north and south.

[36]
This is a large cavernous room, north of a large reservoir.

[37]
This is a large cavernous room, to the south of which was formerly
a reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely
a wide stream running through the center of the room.

[38]
There is a tunnel leaving the room to the north.

[39]
This is a large room with giant icicles hanging from the walls
and ceiling.  There are passages to the north and east.

[40]
Part of the glacier has been melted.

[41]
There is a large passageway leading westward.

[42]
This is a large square room with tall ceilings.  On the south wall
is an enormous mirror which fills the entire wall.  There are exits
on the other three sides of the room.

[43]
Unfortunately, you have managed to destroy it by your reckless
actions.

[44]
  BOOOOOOOOOM

[45]
This is a large room which seems to be air conditioned.  In one
corner there is a machine (?) which is shaped somewhat like a clothes
dryer.  On the "panel" there is a switch which is labelled in an
obscure dialect of Swahili.  Fortunately, I know this dialect, and
the label translates to START.  The switch does not appear to be
manipulable by any human hand (unless the fingers are about 1/16 by
1/4 inch).  On the front of the machine is a large lid, which is #.

[46]
closed

[47]
The cave is very windy at the moment, and your candles have blown out.

[48]
This is a small room that has only one door, to the east.

[49]
In the corner of the room on the ceiling is a large vampire bat who
is obviously deranged and holding his nose.

[50]
A deranged giant vampire bat (a reject from WUMPUS) swoops down
from the ceiling and lifts you away...

[51]
This is the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling of
another room below.  Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a
wooden railing which circles the dome.

[52]
Hanging down from the railing is a rope which ends about ten feet
from the floor below.

[53]
I'm afraid that the leap you attempted has done you in.

[54]
This is a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down
staircase.  To the west is a narrow twisting tunnel, covered with
a thin layer of dust.  Above you is a large dome painted with scenes
depicting elfin hacking rites.  Up around the edge of the dome (20
feet up) is a wooden railing.  In the center of the room there is
a white marble pedestal.

[55]
A large piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some
five feet above your head.

[56]
This is a circular room with passages off in eight directions.

[57]
Your compass needle spins wildly, and you cannot get your bearings.

[58]
According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic
fields in the room are so intense as to cause you to be electrocuted.
I really don't know, but in any event, something just killed you.

[59]
You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed:

 "Abandon every hope, all ye who enter here."

The gate is open.  Through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of
mangled corpses in one corner.  Thousands of voices, lamenting some
hideous fate, can be heard.

[60]
The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your
attempts to pass.

[61]
There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
cavern:  "Begone, chomper!"  Apparently, the voice thinks you
are an evil spirit and dismisses you from the land of the living.

[62]
You are not equipped for an exorcism.

[63]
Each word of the prayer reverberates through the hall in a deafening
confusion.  As the last word fades, a voice, loud and commanding,
speaks:  "Begone, fiends!"  The spirits, sensing the presense
of a greater power, flee through the walls.

[64]
You have entered the land of the living dead, a large desolate room.
Although it is apparently uninhabited, you can hear the sounds of
thousands of lost souls weeping and moaning.  In the east corner are
stacked the remains of dozens of previous adventurers who were less
fortunate than yourself.  To the east is an ornate passage, apparently
recently constructed.  A passage exits to the west.

[65]
Amid the desolation, you spot what appears to be your head,
tastefully impaled on the end of a long pole.

[66]
You are standing on the top of Flood Control Dam #3, which was
quite a tourist attraction in times far distant.  There are paths
to the north, south, east, and down.

[67]
The sluice gates on the dam are closed.  Behind the dam, there can
be seen a wide lake.  A small stream is formed by the runoff from
the lake.

[68]
It appears that the dam has been opened, since the water level behind
the dam is low and the sluice gate is open.  Water is rushing down-
stream through the gates.

[69]
There is a control panel here.  There is a large metal bolt on the
panel.  Above the bolt is a small green plastic bubble.

[70]
The green bubble is glowing.

[71]
The water level is now up to your ankles.

[72]
The water level is now up to your shins.

[73]
The water level is now up to your knees.

[74]
The water level is now up to your hips.

[75]
The water level is now up to your waist.

[76]
The water level is now up to your chest.

[77]
The water level is now up to your neck.

[78]
The water level is now over your head.

[79]
The water level is now high in your lungs.

[80]
The room is full of water and cannot be entered.

[81]
I'm afraid you have done drowned yourself.

[82]
You hear a scream of anguish as you violate the robber's hideaway.
Using passages unknown to you, he rushes to its defense.

[83]
The thief gestures mysteriously, and the treasures in the room
suddenly vanish.

[84]
Something seems funny about the feel of the buoy.

[85]
Unfortunately, a rubber raft doesn't provide much protection from
the unfriendly sorts of rocks and boulders one meets at the bottom
of many waterfalls.  Including this one.

[86]
You seem to be digging a hole here.

[87]
The hole is getting deeper, but that's about it.

[88]
You are surrounded by a wall of sand on all sides.

[89]
You can see a small statue in the sand.

[90]
The wall collapses, smothering you.

[91]
There is nothing to dig into here.

[92]
You are digging into a pile of bat guano.

[93]
You seem to be getting knee deep in guano.

[94]
You are covered with bat turds, cretin.

[95]
This is getting you nowhere.

[96]
You are at the top of Aragain Falls, an enormous waterfall with a
drop of about 450 feet.  The only path here is on the north end.

[97]
A beautiful rainbow can be seen over the falls and to the east.

[98]
A solid rainbow spans the falls.

[99]
According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic
fields in the room are so intense as to fry all the delicate innards
of the robot.  I really don't know, but in any event, smoke is coming
out of its ears, and it has stopped moving.

[100]
You are on a wide ledge high into the volcano.  The rim of the
volcano is about 200 feet above, and there is a precipitous drop
below to the floor.

[101]
The way to the south is blocked by rubble.

[102]
There is a small door to the south.

[103]
You already have it.

[104]
This is a dusty old room which is virtually featureless, except
for an exit on the north side.

[105]
Imbedded in the far wall is a rusty old box.  It appears that
the box is somewhat damaged, since an oblong hole has been
chipped out of the front of it.

[106]
On the far wall is a rusty box, whose door has been blown off.

[107]
This is a room with a low ceiling which is circular in shape.
There are exits to the east and southeast.

[108]
As you enter, your compass starts spinning wildly.

[109]
The ledge has collapsed and cannot be landed on.

[110]
The ledge collapses, giving you a narrow escape.

[111]
The force of the explosion has caused the ledge to collapse belatedly.

[112]
The ledge collapses, leaving you with no place to land.

[113]
The ledge collapses, probably as a result of the explosion.  A large
chunk of it, which is attached to the hook, drags you down to the
ground.  Fatally.

[114]
The way is blocked by debris from an explosion.

[115]
You may recall your recent explosion.  Well, probably as a result of
that, you hear an ominous rumbling, as if one of the rooms in the
dungeon has collapsed.

[116]
The room trembles and 50,000 pounds of rock fall on you,
turning you into a pancake.

[117]
The house shakes, and the ceiling of the room you're in collapses,
turning you into a pancake.

[118]
A volcano gnome seems to walk straight out of the wall and says,
"I have a very busy appointment schedule and little time to waste on
trespassers, but for a small fee, I'll show you the way out."  You
notice that the gnome is nervously glancing at his watch.

[119]
Suddenly a sinister, wraithlike figure, cloaked and hooded, appears
seeming to float in the air before you.  In a low, almost inaudible
voice he says, "I welcome you to the ranks of the chosen of Zork.  You
have persisted through many trials and tests and have overcome them
all.  One such as yourself is fit to join even the implementers!"
He then raises his oaken staff and, chuckling, drifts away like a
wisp of smoke, his laughter fading in the distance.

[121]
Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell directions in here.

[122]
The slag turns out to be rather insubstantial and crumbles into dust
at your touch.  It must not have been very valuable.

[123]
The lid opens.

[124]
The lid closes.

[125]
Look around.

[126]
You think it isn't?

[127]
I think you've already done that.

[128]
The trophy case is securely fastened to the wall (perhaps to foil any
attempt by robbers to remove it).

[129]
The bottle hits the far wall and is decimated.

[130]
The basket is at the other end of the chain.

[131]
A brilliant maneuver destroys the bottle.

[132]
The water splashes on the walls and evaporates immediately.

[133]
The water spills to the floor and evaporates immediately.

[134]
It is not tied to anything.

[135]
There is nothing it can be tied to.

[136]
The rope is already attached.

[137]
The rope drops over the side and comes within ten feet of the floor.

[138]
I see no objects here.

[139]
The rope is now untied.

[140]
The rope drops gently to the floor below.

[141]
The rope is tied to the railing.

[142]
The lamp has smashed into the floor, and the light has gone out.

[143]
The rug is too heavy to lift, but in trying to raise it you
notice an irregularity beneath it.

[144]
The rug is extremely heavy and cannot be carried.

[145]
With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room.
With the rug moved, the dusty cover of a closed trap door appears.

[146]
Having moved the carpet previously, you find it impossible
to move it again.

[147]
You are stopped by a cloud of poisonous gas.

[148]
Time passes... and you die from some obscure poisoning.

[149]
The gnome glances at his watch.  "Oops!  I'm late for an
appointment."  He disappears, leaving you alone on the ledge.

[150]
Now you've done it.  It seems that the brick has other properties
than weight, namely the ability to blow you to smithereens.

[151]
There is an explosion nearby.

[152]
The wire rapidly burns into nothingness.

[153]
The match has gone out.

[154]
The lamp appears to be getting dimmer.

[155]
The lamp is dying.

[156]
The candles grow short.

[157]
The candles are very short.

[158]
The leaves burn, and the neighbors start to complain.

[159]
The sight of someone carrying a pile of burning leaves so offends
the neighbors that they come over and put you out.

[160]
As you pick up the rusty knife, your sword gives a single pulse
of blinding blue light.

[161]
As the knife approaches its victim, your mind is submerged by an
overmastering will.  Slowly, your hand turns, until the rusty blade
is an inch from your neck.  The knife seems to sing as it savagely
cuts your throat.

[162]
A ghost appears in the room and is appalled by your desecration
of the remains of a fellow adventurer.  He casts a curse on
all of your valuables and orders them banished to the land of
the living dead.  The ghost leaves, muttering obscenities.

[163]
There is a rumble from deep within the earth, and the room shakes.

[164]
There is an ugly person staring at you.

[165]
The mirror is broken into many pieces.

[166]
Nobody but a greedy surgeon would allow you to attempt that trick.

[167]
You have broken the mirror.  I hope you have a seven years supply of
good luck handy.

[168]
Haven't you done enough already?

[169]
The torch hits the glacier and explodes into a great ball of flame,
devouring the glacier.  The water from the melting glacier rushes
downstream, carrying the torch with it.  In place of the glacier,
there is a passageway leading west.

[170]
The melting glacier seems to have carried the torch away, leaving
you in the dark.

[171]
The glacier is unmoved by your ridiculous attempt.

[172]
Part of the glacier melts, drowning you under a torrent of water.

[173]
burned out ivory torch

[174]
There is a burned out ivory torch here.

[175]
The basket is raised to the top of the shaft.

[176]
The basket is lowered to the bottom of the shaft.

[177]
The cage is securely fastened to the iron chain.

[178]
You seem unable to affect these spirits.

[179]
How can you affect a spirit with material objects?

[180]
The book is open to page 569.

[181]
As hard as you try, the book cannot be closed.

[182]
A booming voice says, "Wrong, cretin!", and you notice that you
have turned into a pile of dust.

[183]
I'm afraid that you have run out of matches.

[184]
One of the matches starts to burn.

[185]
The match is out.

[186]
The tube refuses to accept anything.

[187]
The cyclops yawns and stares at the thing that woke him.

[188]
The cyclops, tired of all your games and trickery, eats you.
The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  Just like mom used to make 'em."

[189]
The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  I love hot peppers!  But oh, could I use
a drink.  Perhaps I could drink the blood of that thing."  From the
gleam in his eye, it could be surmised that you are "that thing".

[190]
The cyclops looks tired and quickly falls fast asleep (what did you
put in that drink, anyway?).

[191]
The cyclops is apparently not thirsty and refuses your generosity.

[192]
The cyclops may be hungry, but there is a limit.

[193]
The cyclops is not so stupid as to eat that!

[194]
The cyclops seems somewhat agitated.

[195]
The cyclops appears to be getting more agitated.

[196]
The cyclops is moving about the room, looking for something.

[197]
The cyclops was looking for salt and pepper.  I think he is gathering
condiments for his upcoming snack.

[198]
The cyclops is moving toward you in an unfriendly manner.

[199]
You have two choices:  1. Leave  2. Become dinner.

[200]
Your actions don't appear to be doing much harm to the cyclops, but
they do not exactly lower your insurance premiums, either.

[201]
The cyclops ignores all injuries to his body with a shrug.

[202]
The cyclops doesn't take kindly to being grabbed.

[203]
You cannot tie the cyclops, although he is fit to be tied.

[204]
Realizing just in time that you'd be stabbed in the back if you
attempted to take the chalice, you return to the fray.

[205]
Congratulations!  Unlike the other vandals, who merely stole the
artist's masterpieces, you have destroyed one.

[206]
worthless piece of canvas

[207]
There is a worthless piece of canvas here.

[208]
With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow entry.

[209]
The window closes (more easily than it opened).

[210]
The bolt won't turn with your best effort.

[211]
The sluice gates open, and water pours through the dam.

[212]
The sluice gates close, and water starts to collect behind the dam.

[213]
You can't do that!

[214]
The grating is locked.

[215]
The grating opens to reveal trees above you.

[216]
The grating opens.

[217]
The grating is unlocked.

[218]
The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending
into darkness.

[219]
The door swings shut and closes.

[220]
The door is locked from above.

[221]
The door cannot be opened.

[222]
You cannot burn this door.

[223]
The door is invulnerable.

[224]
You cannot damage this door.

[225]
The door is still under warranty.

[226]
The machine comes to life (figuratively) with a dazzling display
of colored lights and bizarre noises.  After a few moments, the
excitement fades.

[227]
The machine doesn't seem to want to do anything.

[228]
A force keeps you from taking the bodies.

[229]
The voice of the guardian of the dungeon booms out from the darkness,
"Your disrespect has cost you your life!" and places your head on a pole.

[230]
The lights within the room shut off.

[231]
The lights within the room come on.

[232]
Click.

[233]
There is a rumbling sound, and a stream of water appears to burst
from the east wall of the room (apparently, a leak has occurred
in a pipe).

[234]
The blue button appears to be jammed.

[235]
The boat must be on the ground to be inflated.

[236]
The boat inflates and appears seaworthy.

[237]
You don't have enough lung power to inflate it.

[238]
This boat will not inflate since some moron put a hole in it.

[239]
Well done.  The boat is repaired.

[240]
There is a hissing sound, and the boat deflates.

[241]
The boat deflates.

[242]
You can't deflate the boat while you're in it.

[243]
The boat must be on the ground to be deflated.

[244]
Very good.

[245]
The rainbow seems to have become somewhat run of the mill.

[246]
Suddenly, the rainbow appears to become solid and, I venture,
walkable (I think the giveaway was the stairs and bannister).

[247]
The structural integrity of the rainbow seems to have declined
precipitously, leaving you about 450 feet in the air, supported
by water vapor.

[248]
The ballon is fastened to the hook.

[249]
The wire is not tied to anything.

[250]
The wire falls off the hook.

[251]
The box is imbedded in the wall.

[252]
What do you expect, BOOM?

[253]
The box has no door!

[254]
The box is rusted and will not open.

[255]
The box is not open, chomper!

[256]
The wire starts to burn.

[257]
"Thank you very much," he says.  "I don't believe I've seen a
# as beautiful.  Follow me."  A door appears on the west end
of the ledge.  Through the door, you can see a narrow chimney
sloping downward.  The gnome moves quickly, and he disappears
from sight.

[258]
"That wasn't quite what I had in mind," he says, crunching
the # in his rock hard hands.

[259]
The gnome appears increasingly nervous.

[260]
Although the implementers are gone, they foresaw that some cretin
would tamper with their remains.  Therefore, they took steps to
prevent this.

[261]
Unfortunately, we've run out of poles.  Therefore, in punishment for
your transgression, we shall deprive you of all your valuables, and
of your life.

[262]
Congratulations!  You've managed to break all the bottles.  Fortunately
for your feet, they were made of magic glass and disappear immediately.

[263]
As you reach for the sphere, a steel cage falls from the ceiling
to entrap you.  To make matters worse, poisonous gas starts coming
into the room.

[264]
As the robot reaches for sphere, a steel cage falls from the
ceiling.  The robot attempts to fend it off but is trapped below it.
Alas, the robot short circuits in his vain attempt to escape and
crushes the sphere beneath him as he falls to the floor.

[265]
There is a giant spark, and you are fried to a crisp.

[266]
Nothing seems to happen.

[267]
The whirring increases in intensity slightly.

[268]
The whirring decreases in intensity slightly.

[269]
A dull thump is heard in the distance.

[270]
The flask breaks into pieces.

[271]
Noxious vapors prevent your entry.

[272]
Just before you pass out, you notice that the vapors from the
flask's contents are fatal.

[273]
Suddenly, the room appears to have become very large.

[274]
The only writing visible is a capital E.  The rest is too small to
be clearly visible.

[275]
You can't see through that!

[276]
The letters appear larger but are still too small to read.

[277]
The icing, now visible, says "Explode".

[278]
The icing, now visible, says "Evaporate".

[279]
The icing, now visible, says "Enlarge".

[280]
The pool of water evaporates, revealing a tin of rare spices.

[281]
The door to the room seems to be blocked by sticky orange rubble
from an explosion.  Probably some careless adventurer was playing
with blasting cakes.

[282]
You have been blasted to smithereens (whatever they are).

[283]
The room around you seems to be getting smaller.

[284]
The room seems to have become too small to hold you.  It seems
that the walls are not as compressible as your body, which is
more or less demolished.

[285]
The robot is injured (being of shoddy construction) and falls to the
floor in a pile of garbage, which disintegrates before your eyes.

[286]
How romantic!

[287]
If you insist... Poof, you're dead!

[288]
The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the
earth.  Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable
appetite is tempered by its fear of light.  No grue has ever been
seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws
to tell the tale.

[289]
There is no grue here, but I'm sure there is at least one lurking in
the darkness nearby.  I wouldn't let my light go out if I were you!

[290]
The bucket rises and comes to a stop.

[291]
The bucket descends and comes to a stop.

[292]
You notice that the # has burned out, and that
the cloth bag is starting to deflate.

[293]
I hope you have more light than from a #.

[294]
I didn't realize that adventurers are stupid enough to light a
# in a room which reeks of coal gas.  Fortunately,
there is still justice in the world.

[295]
Oh, dear.  It appears that the smell coming from this room was coal
gas.  I would have thought twice about carrying a # in here.

[296]
There is now a puddle in the middle of the #.

[297]
The water leaks out of the # and evaporates immediately.

[298]
You won't melt it with a #.

[299]
The bolt can't be turned with your #.

[300]
It seems that a # won't do.

[301]
With a #?

[302]
The robot gladly takes the # and nods his head-like
appendage in thanks.

[303]
With a #?  Surely you jest.

[304]
He who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is not fit for the
kingdom of winners.  In any case, "BACK" doesn't work.

[305]
You'll have to speak up if you expect me to hear you.

[306]
I don't know how to do that.  I win in all cases.

[307]
At your service!

[308]
The Frobozz Company, Ltd., created, owns, and operates this dungeon.

[309]
Well, FOO, BAR, and BLETCH to you too!

[310]
It could very well be too late.

[311]
The dungeon is ALWAYS open (always room for one more).

[312]
Naturally!

[313]
Aaaarrrrrrgggggggghhhhhhhhhh!

[314]
Very good.  Now you can go to the second grade.

[315]
Have you tried hopping around the dungeon, too?

[316]
Are you enjoying yourself?

[317]
Wheeeeee!

[318]
Do you expect me to applaud?

[319]
Such language in a high-class establishment like this!

[320]
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

[321]
It's not so bad.  You could have been killed already.

[322]
Tough shit, asshole.

[323]
Oh, dear.  Such language from a supposedly winning adventurer!

[324]
That word is henceforth replaced with DUNGEON.

[325]
A hollow voice says, "Cretin."

[326]
Brief descriptions.

[327]
Maximum verbosity.

[328]
No long descriptions.

[329]
You can see:  A #.

[330]
Swimming is not allowed in this dungeon.

[331]
I don't really see how.

[332]
I think that swimming is best performed in water.

[333]
Perhaps it is your head that is swimming.

[334]
Wasn't he an Indian?

[335]
I didn't think you would REALLY try to go over the falls in a
barrel.  It seems that some 450 feet below, you were met by a number
of unfriendly rocks and boulders, causing your immediate demise.
Is this what "Over a barrel" means?

[336]
Wasn't he a sailor?

[337]
The cyclops, hearing the name of his father's deadly nemesis, flees
the room by knocking down the wall on the north side of the room.

[338]
There is a clap of thunder, and the east door opens.

[339]
The rope dangles down the slide.

[340]
If you pray enough, your prayers may be answered.

[341]
Nothing happens.

[342]
I don't really know how to do that.

[343]
Do you wish to leave the game?

[344]
Underneath the pile of leaves is a grating.

[345]
Underneath the rug is a closed trap door.

[346]
Hello.

[347]
Good day.

[348]
Nice weather we've been having lately.

[349]
Goodbye.

[350]
Here, nothing happens.

[351]
Nothing happens here.

[352]
I think that phrase is getting a bit worn out.

[353]
You seem to be repeating yourself.

[354]
The # bows his head to you in greeting.

[355]
I think that only schizophrenics say "Hello" to a #.

[356]
It is impossible to read in the dark.

[357]
How does one look through a #?

[358]
How can I read a #?

[359]
How, exactly, can I ring that?

[360]
Ding, dong.

[361]
I'm not sure that a # can be melted.

[362]
If you wish, but I can't understand why.

[363]
Dental hygiene is highly recommended, but I'm not sure what
you want to brush them with.

[364]
A nice idea, but with a #?

[365]
Well, you seem to have been brushing your teeth with some sort of
glue.  As a result, your mouth gets glued together with your nose,
and you die of respiratory failure.

[366]
Unfortunately, the troll can't hear you.

[367]
Inflating it further would probably burst it.

[368]
How can you inflate that?

[369]
Come on, now!

[370]
The # isn't sleeping.

[371]
This seems to have no effect.

[372]
does not seem to do anything

[373]
is not notably useful

[374]
isn't very interesting

[375]
doesn't appear worthwhile

[376]
has no effect

[377]
doesn't do anything

[378]
Kicking a # #.

[379]
Waving a # #.

[380]
Playing in this way with a # #.

[381]
Fiddling with a # #.

[382]
Pushing the # #.

[383]
I don't think so.

[384]
This cannot be tied, so it cannot be untied!

[385]
How can you tie that to anything?

[386]
You can't tie the # to that.

[387]
You could certainly never tie the # with that!

[388]
The # struggles and you cannot tie him up.

[389]
Why would you tie up a #?

[390]
You can't turn that.

[391]
You certainly can't turn it with a #.

[392]
Digging with the # is slow and tedious.

[393]
Digging with a # is silly.

[394]
I don't think that anybody is home.

[395]
Why knock on a #?

[396]
It sounds like there is something inside the #.

[397]
The contents of the # spill out.

[398]
I can't get to that to move it.

[399]
You can't move the #.

[400]
You can't turn that on.

[401]
It is already on.

[402]
You can't turn that off.

[403]
It is already off.

[404]
The # is now on.

[405]
The # is now off.

[406]
It is now pitch black.

[407]
You must tell me how to do that to a #.

[408]
The # cannot be opened.

[409]
Opened.

[410]
Opening the # reveals:

[411]
The # cannot be closed.

[412]
It is already open.

[413]
It is already closed.

[414]
Closed.

[415]
There is a # here.

[416]
You are carrying a #.

[417]
It is in the #, which is in the room.

[418]
It is in the #, which you are carrying.

[419]
Time passes...

[420]
The # must be on the ground to be boarded.

[421]
I suppose you have a theory on boarding a #.

[422]
You are already in the #, cretin!

[423]
You are now in the #.

[424]
You aren't in that!

[425]
You realize, just in time, that disembarking here would probably
be fatal.

[426]
You are on your own feet again.

[427]
You can't go there without a vehicle.

[428]
You can't go there in a #.

[429]
I see nothing special about the #.

[430]
It is pitch black.  You are likely to be eaten by a grue.

[431]
You are in the #.

[432]
The # has died.

[433]
The troll, disarmed, cowers in terror, pleading for his life in
the guttural tongue of the trolls.

[434]
The troll, now worried about this encounter, recovers his
bloody axe.

[435]
An unconscious troll is sprawled on the floor.  All passages out
of the room are open.

[436]
A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages
out of the room.

[437]
The troll stirs, quickly resuming a fighting stance.

[438]
The troll spits in your face, saying "Better luck next time".

[439]
The troll laughs at your puny gesture.

[440]
The troll, who is remarkably coordinated, catches the #

[441]
The troll, who is not overly proud, graciously accepts the gift

[442]
and not having the most discriminating tastes, gleefully eats it.

[443]
and being for the moment sated, throws it back.  Fortunately, the
troll has poor control, and the knife falls on the floor.  He does
not look pleased.

[444]
Sadly, a # can't be filled with a #.

[445]
You can't take the #.

[446]
Aren't you forgetting something?

[447]
That would be a good trick.

[448]
The # is too big to jump over.

[449]
You should have looked before you leaped.

[450]
I'm afraid that leap was a bit much for your weak frame.

[451]
In the movies, your life would be passing in front of your eyes.

[452]
Geronimo...

[453]
I don't think that the # would agree with you.

[454]
I think you should get that first.

[455]
Thank you very much.  It really hit the spot.

[456]
How can I drink that?

[457]
I'd like to, but I can't get to that.

[458]
Thank you very much.  I was rather thirsty, probably from all
this talking.

[459]
The # catches fire.

[460]
Unfortunately, you were holding it at the time.

[461]
You don't have that.

[462]
The # catches fire and is consumed.

[463]
I don't think you can burn a #.

[464]
It doesn't seem to work.

[465]
Can you unlock a grating with a #?

[466]
Trying to destroy a # #.

[467]
Trying to kill a # #.

[468]
Trying to attack a # #.

[469]
There is nothing here to attack.

[470]
I've known strange people, but attacking a #?

[471]
with your bare hands is suicidal

[472]
with that is very self-destructive

[473]
You are in perfect health.

[474]
You have a light wound.

[475]
You have a serious wound.

[476]
You have several wounds.

[477]
You have serious wounds.

[478]
You are at death's door.

[479]
You can be killed by one more light wound.

[480]
You can be killed by a serious wound.

[481]
You can survive one serious wound.

[482]
You are strong enough to take several wounds.

[483]
You have been killed once.

[484]
You have been killed twice.

[485]
This gives you the rank of Cheater.

[486]
This gives you the rank of Wizard.

[487]
This gives you the rank of Master.

[488]
This gives you the rank of Winner.

[489]
This gives you the rank of Hacker.

[490]
This gives you the rank of Adventurer.

[491]
This gives you the rank of Junior Adventurer.

[492]
This gives you the rank of Novice Adventurer.

[493]
This gives you the rank of Amateur Adventurer.

[494]
This gives you the rank of Beginner.

[495]
Your sword is no longer glowing.

[496]
Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.

[497]
You sword has begun to glow very brightly.

[498]
Annoyed to be left unarmed in such an obviously dangerous
neighborhood, the thief slips off into the shadows.

[499]
The robber, somewhat surprised by this turn of events, nimbly
recovers his stilletto.

[500]
The booty from his bag remains:  A #.

[501]
As the thief dies, the power of his magic decreases, and his
treasures reappear:  A #.

[502]
  A #.

[503]
There is a suspicious-looking individual, holding a bag, leaning
against one wall.  He is armed with a vicious-looking stilletto.

[504]
There is a suspicious-looking individual lying unconscious on the
ground.  His bag and stilletto seem to have vanished.

[505]
The robber revives, briefly feigning continued unconsciousness, and
when he sees his moment, scrambles away from you.

[506]
Once you got him, what would you do with him?

[507]
You missed.  The thief makes no attempt to take the knife, although
it would be a fine addition to the collection in his bag.  He does
seem angered by your attempt.

[508]
You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees.

[509]
You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees,
but the contents of his bag fall on the floor.

[510]
Your proposed victim suddenly recovers consciousness.

[511]
The thief seems rather offended by your offer.  Do you think he's as
stupid as you are?

[512]
The thief places the # in his bag and thanks you politely.

[513]
The candles are not lit.

[514]
The flame is extinguished.

[515]
Alas, there's not much left of the candles.  Certainly not enough to
burn.

[516]
With what?

[517]
The candles are lit.

[518]
The candles are already lit.

[519]
You have to light them with something that's burning, you know.

[520]
You realize just in time that the candles are already lit.

[521]
The heat from the torch is so intense that the candles are vaporized.

[522]
Oh, no!  You walked into the slavering fangs of a lurking grue.

[523]
Oh, no!  A fearsome grue slithered into the room and devoured you.

[524]
You can't go that way.

[525]
The # is closed.

[526]
I can't reach that.

[527]
You aren't carrying that.

[528]
Dropped.

[529]
Thrown.

[530]
You watch as the balloon slowly lands.

[531]
The balloon has landed.

[532]
You have landed, but the balloon did not survive.

[533]
You watch as the balloon slowly descends.

[534]
The balloon descends.

[535]
You hear a boom and notice that the balloon is falling to the ground.

[536]
Your balloon has hit the rim of the volcano, ripping the cloth and
causing you to drop 500 feet.  Did you get your flight insurance?

[537]
You watch as the balloon slowly ascends.

[538]
The balloon ascends.

[539]
You watch as the balloon slowly floats away.  It seems to be ascending,
due to its light load.

[540]
The balloon leaves the ledge.

[541]
You watch as the balloon slowly lifts off.

[542]
The balloon rises slowly from the ground.

[543]
The cloth bag is draped over the basket.

[544]
The cloth bag is inflated, and there is a # burning
in the receptacle.

[545]
The balloon is tied to the hook.

[546]
I'm afraid you can't control the balloon in this way.

[547]
You are tied to the ledge.

[548]
You don't really want to hold a burning #.

[549]
The receptacle is already occupied.

[550]
The # burns inside the receptacle.

[551]
The cloth bag inflates as it fills with hot air.

[552]
Not likely.

[553]
An interesting idea, but...

[554]
A valiant attempt.

[555]
You can't be serious.

[556]
Not a prayer.

[557]
What a concept!

[558]
Your load is too heavy.  You will have to leave something behind.

[559]
Taken.

[560]
Nice try.

[561]
I can't do that.

[562]
I can't reach inside.

[563]
How can you do that?

[564]
The # is already in the #.

[565]
It won't fit.

[566]
I can't reach the #.

[567]
The cage shakes and is hurled across the room.

[568]
"I am sorry but that action is difficult for a being with no mouth."

[569]
"My vision is not sufficiently acute to read such small type."

[570]
"I am only a stupid robot and cannot perform that command."

[571]
ECHO
The acoustics of the room change subtly.

[572]
Almost as soon as the # breathes his last, a cloud of
sinister black smoke envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the
carcass has disappeared.

[573]
The # contains:

[574]
The # also contains:

[575]
You are carrying:

[576]
The # is carrying:

[577]
By some miracle of elven technology, you have managed to
stop the leak in the dam.

[578]
You are empty handed.

[579]
It is too dark in here to see.

[580]
#:

[581]
I could't find anything.

[582]
I couldn't find any valuables.

[583]
Someone carrying a large bag is casually leaning against one of the
walls here.  He does not speak, but it is clear from his aspect that
the bag will be taken only over his dead body.

[584]
Your opponent, determining discretion to be the better part of
valor, decides to terminate this little contretemps.  With a rueful
nod of his head, he steps backward into the gloom and disappears.

[585]
The holder of the large bag just left, looking disgusted.
Fortunately, he took nothing.

[586]
A "lean and hungry" gentleman just wandered through.  Finding
nothing of value, he left disgruntled.

[587]
A seedy-looking individual with a large bag just wandered through
the room.  On the way, he quietly abstracted all valuables from the
room and from your possession, mumbling something about, "Do unto
others before...".

[588]
The other occupant (he of the large bag), finding nothing of value,
left disgusted.

[589]
The other occupant just left carrying his large bag.  You may not
have noticed that he robbed you blind first.

[590]
You hear, off in the distance, someone saying, "My, I wonder what
this fine # is doing here?"

[591]
You are still recovering from that last blow, so your attack is
ineffective.

[592]
Attacking the # is pointless.

[593]
Well, you really did it that time.  Is suicide painless?

[594]
The # slowly regains his feet.

[595]
The unconscious # cannot defend himself:  he dies.

[596]
It appears that the last blow was too much for you.  I'm afraid
that you are dead.

[597]
Saved.

[598]
I can't access the save file.

[599]
Restored.

[600]
Your save file is obsolete and cannot be restored.

[601]
I don't understand that.

[602]
You cannot talk to that!

[603]
You cannot talk through another person.

[604]
Please input the entire command again.

[605]
Fortunately, you still have a #.

[606]
This is a room with an exit on the west side, and a staircase
leading up.

[607]
A cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere
adventurers), blocks the staircase.  From his state of health
and the bloodstains on the walls, you gather that he is not very
friendly, though he likes people.

[608]
The cyclops is standing in the corner, eyeing you closely.  I don't
think he likes you very much.  He looks extremely hungry, even for
a cyclops.

[609]
The cyclops, having eaten the hot peppers, appears to be gasping.
His enflamed tongue protrudes from his man-sized mouth.

[610]
The cyclops is sleeping blissfully at the foot of the stairs.

[611]
On the north of the room is a wall which used to be solid, but which
now has a cyclops-shaped hole in it.

[612]
The bottle is closed.

[613]
The bottle is already full.

[614]
The bottle is now full of water.

[615]
The water slips through your fingers.

[616]
Misformed or empty substring.

[617]
Too many objects.

[618]
Direction intermixed with other words in command.

[619]
Empty "except" clause.

[620]
I can't reach that from inside the #.

[621]
What should I do with the #?

[622]
Huh?

[623]
Above you is an open trap door.

[624]
Too many verbs.

[625]
Normally, I would attempt to rectify your condition, but I'm ashamed
to say my abilities are not equal to dealing with your present state
of disrepair.  Please let me express my profoundest regrets.

[626]
The thief, being temporarily incapacitated, is unable to acknowledge
your greeting with his usual graciousness.

[627]
The thief is taken aback by your unexpected generosity but accepts
the # and stops to admire its beauty.

[628]
The # is open, but I can't tell what's beyond it.

[629]
The # is empty.

[630]
I don't know how to look inside a #.

[631]
There is nothing interesting there.

[632]
I don't really see how.

[633]
The implementers are dead;  therefore, they do not respond.

[634]
You cannot wind up a #.

[635]
You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.

[636]
A metallic voice says, "Hello, Intruder!  Your unauthorized presence
in the vault area of the Bank of Zork has set off all sorts of nasty
surprises, several of which seem to have been fatal.  This message
brought to you by the Frobozz Magic Alarm Company."

[637]
An epicene Gnome of Zurich, wearing a three-piece suit and carrying a
safety deposit box, materializes in the room.  "You seem to have
forgotten to deposit your valuables," he says, tapping the lid of the
box impatiently.  "We don't usually allow customers to use the boxes
here, but we can make this ONE exception, I suppose..."  He looks
askance at you over his wire-rimmed bifocals.

[638]
The gnome looks impatient:  "I may have another customer waiting;
you'll just have to fend for yourself, I'm afraid."  He disappears,
leaving you alone in the bare room.

[639]
Talk about eating rich foods!

[640]
Nothing like having money to burn!

[641]
"I wouldn't put THAT in a safety deposit box," remarks the gnome with
disdain, tossing it over his shoulder, where it disappears with an
understated "pop".

[642]
The gnome carefully places the # in the
deposit box.  "Let me show you the way out," he says, making it clear
that he will be pleased to see the last of you.  Then, you are momentarily
disoriented, and when you recover, you are back at the Bank Entrance.

[643]
The gnome says, "Well, I never!" and disappears with a snap of his
fingers, leaving you alone.

[644]
The gnome appears increasingly impatient.

[645]
There is an unpleasant grinding noise from inside the canary.

[646]
The canary chirps blithely, if somewhat tinnily, for a short time.

[647]
The canary chirps, slightly off key, an aria from a forgotten opera.
From out of the greenery flies a lovely song bird.  It perches on a
limb just over your head and opens its beak to sing.  As it does so,
a beautiful brass bauble drops from its mouth, bounces off the top
of your head, and lands glimmering in the grass.  As the canary winds
down, the song bird flies away.

[648]
The cliff is too steep for climbing.

[649]
The egg is already open.

[650]
There is no obvious way to open the egg.

[651]
I doubt you could do that without damaging it.

[652]
The egg is now open, but the clumsiness of your attempt has
seriously diminished its esthetic appeal.

[653]
The concept of using a # is certainly original.

[654]
Not to say that using a # isn't original too...

[655]
Your rather indelicate handling of the egg has caused it some damage.
The egg is now open.

[656]
Climbing the walls is of no avail.

[657]
Bizarre!

[658]
The egg falls to the ground and is seriously damaged.

[659]
The # falls to the ground.

[660]
You are about ten feet above the ground nestled among some large
branches.  The nearest branch above you is beyond your reach.

[661]
On the ground below you can see:

[662]
I can't see any wall here.

[663]
That cannot be turned.

[664]
You would be lost without me.

[665]
You don't have the #.

[666]
The song bird is not here, but it is probably nearby.

[667]
I can't see any song bird here.

[668]
You feel somewhat disoriented as you pass through...

[669]
You hit your head against the # as you attempt this feat.

[670]
You can't go more than part way through the curtain.

[671]
That would involve quite a contortion!

[672]
You are in it, loser!

[673]
As you try, your hand seems to go through it.

[674]
The # goes through it.

[675]
The # passes through the wall and vanishes.

[676]
The curtain dims slightly as the # passes through.

[677]
I can't do that with everything at once.

[678]
There is a wall there.

[679]
There is no way up.

[680]
There is no way down.

[681]
This is part of the long hallway.  The east and west walls are
dressed stone.  In the center of the hall is a shallow stone channel.
In the center of the room the channel widens into a large hole around
which is engraved a compass rose.

[682]
Somewhat to the south, identical stone statues face each other from
pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent
Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are
portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped
around formidable bludgeons.

[683]
Somewhat to the north, identical stone statues face each other from
pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent
Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are
portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped
around formidable bludgeons.

[684]
A passage enters from the south.

[685]
The Guardians awake and, in perfect unison, destroy you with
their stone bludgeons.  Satisfied, they resume their posts.

[686]
To the north and south are large hallways.

[687]
To the north is a large hallway.

[688]
You are inside a rectangular box of wood whose structure is rather
complicated.  Four sides and the roof are filled in, and the floor
is open.
   As you face the side opposite the entrance, two short sides of
carved and polished wood are to your left and right.  The left panel
is mahogany, the right pine.  The wall you face is red on its left
half and black on its right.  On the entrance side, the wall is white
opposite the red part of the wall it faces, and yellow opposite the
black section.  The painted walls are at least twice the length of
the unpainted ones.  The ceiling is painted blue.
   In the floor is a stone channel about six inches wide and a foot
deep.  The channel is oriented in a north-south direction.  In the
exact center of the room the channel widens into a circular
depression perhaps two feet wide.  Incised in the stone around this
area is a compass rose.
   Running from one short wall to the other at about waist height
is a wooden bar, carefully carved and drilled.  This bar is pierced
in two places.  The first hole is in the center of the bar (and thus
in the center of the room).  The second is at the left end of the room
(as you face opposite the entrance).  Through each hole runs a wooden
pole.
   The pole at the left end of the bar is short, extending about a

[689]
foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is resting on
the stone floor.

[690]
foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been
dropped into a hole carved in the stone floor.

[691]
foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been lifted
out of a hole carved in the stone floor.  There is evidently enough
friction to keep the pole from dropping back down.

[692]
foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been
dropped into the stone channel incised in the floor.

[693]
foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is positioned
above the stone channel in the floor.

[694]
   The long pole at the center of the bar extends from the ceiling
through the bar to the circular area in the stone channel.  The
bottom end of this pole has a T-bar a bit less than two feet long
attached to it.  On the T-bar is carved an arrow.  The arrow and
T-bar are pointing #.

This is a small room, with narrow passages exiting to the north and
south.  A narrow red beam of light crosses the room at the north end,
inches above the floor.

[704]
This is a small room, with narrow passages exiting to the north and
south.  A narrow red beam of light crosses the room at the north end,
inches above the floor.  The beam is stopped halfway across the room
by a # lying on the floor.

[705]
Though large and esthetically pleasing, the marble crypt is empty;
the sarcophagi, bodies, and rich treasures to be expected in a tomb
of this magnificence are missing.  Inscribed on the wall is the motto
of the implementers, "Feel Free".  There is a door leading out of the
crypt to the south.  The door is #.

[706]
This is an east-west corridor which turns north at its eastern
and western ends.  The walls of the corridor are marble.  An
additional passage leads south at the center of the corridor.

[707]
In the center of the north wall of the passage is a bronze door
which is #.

[708]
This is a narrow north-south corridor.  At the south end is a door
and at the north end is an east-west corridor.  The door is #.

[709]
This is a north-south hallway which ends in a large wooden door.

[710]
The wooden door has a barred panel in it at about head height.  The
panel is #, and the door is #.

[711]
This is a large east-west corridor which opens out to a northern
parapet at its center.  You can see flames and smoke as you peer
towards the parapet.  The corridor turns south at its east and west
ends, and due south is a massive wooden door.  In the door is a small
window barred with iron.  The door is #.

[712]
You are standing behind a stone retaining wall which rims a large
parapet overlooking a fiery pit.  It is difficult to see through the
smoke and flame which fills the pit, but it seems to be more or less
bottomless.  It also extends upwards out of sight.  The pit itself
is of roughly dressed stone and is circular in shape.  It is about
two hundred feet in diameter.  The flames generate considerable heat,
so it is rather uncomfortable standing here.
   There is an object here which looks like a sundial.  On it are
an indicator arrow and (in the center) a large button.  On the face
of the dial are numbers "one" through "eight".  The indicator points
to the number "#".

This is a featureless prison cell.  You can see only the flames
and smoke of the pit out of the small window in a closed wooden
door in front of you.

[722]
This is a featureless prison cell.  You can see the east-west
corridor outside the open wooden door in front of you.

[723]
Behind you is a bronze door which seems to be #.

[724]
This is a featureless prison cell.  Its wooden door is securely
fastened, and you can see only the flames and smoke of the pit
out its small window.

[725]
This is a featureless prison cell.  Its wooden door is securely
fastened, and you can see only the flames and smoke of the pit
out its small window.  On the other side of the cell is a bronze
door which seems to be #.

[726]
   As you gleefully examine your new-found riches, the dungeon
master himself materializes beside you and says, "Now that you have
solved all the mysteries of the dungeon, it is time for you to assume
your rightfully-earned place in the scheme of things.  Long have I
waited for one capable of releasing me from my burden!"  He taps you
lightly on the head with his staff and mumbles a few well-chosen spells.
You feel yourself changing, growing older and more stooped.  For a
moment there are two identical mages staring at each other among the
treasures, then you watch as your counterpart dissolves into a mist
and disappears, a sardonic grin on his face.

[727]
Suddenly, as you wait in the dark, you begin to feel somewhat
disoriented.  The feeling passes, but something seems different.
As you regain your composure, the cloaked figure appears before you
and says, "You are now ready to face the ultimate challenge of
Zork.  Should you wish to do this somewhat more quickly in the
future, you will be given a magic phrase which will at any time
transport you by magic to this point.  To select the phrase, say
 INCANT "word"
and you will be told your own magic phrase to use by saying
 INCANT "phrase"
Good luck, and choose wisely!"

[728]
The button pops back to its original position.

[729]
The mirror quietly swings shut.

[730]
The pine wall closes quietly.

[731]
The structure shakes slightly but doesn't move.

[732]
The short pole prevents the structure from rotating.

[733]
The movement of the structure alerts the Guardians.

[734]
The arrow on the compass rose now indicates #.

[735]
The structure rocks back and forth slightly but doesn't move.

[736]
The pine wall swings open.

[737]
The pine door opens into the field of view of the Guardians.

[738]
The structure has reached the end of the stone channel and won't
budge.

[739]
The structure slides # and stops over another compass rose.

[740]
The structure wobbles # and stops over another compass rose.

[741]
The structure wobbles as it moves, alerting the Guardians.

[742]
A Guardian notices a wooden structure creeping by, and his suspicions
are aroused.

[743]
Suddenly, the Guardians realize that someone is trying to sneak by
them in the structure.  They awake and, in perfect unison, hammer
the box and its contents (including you) to a pulp.  Satisfied, they
then resume their posts.

[744]
A Guardian notices the open side of the structure, and his suspicions
are aroused.

[745]
Attacking the Guardians is about as useless as attacking a stone wall.
Unfortunately for you, your futile blow attracts their attention, and
they manage to dispatch you effortlessly.

[746]
The statues are impassive.

[747]
The dungeon master is taken momentarily by surprise.  He dodges your
blow and then, with a disappointed expression on his face, he raises
his staff and traces a complicated pattern in the air.  As it
completes you crumble into dust.

[748]
"I'm willing to accompany you but not to ride in your pocket!"

[749]
The pole is now slightly above the floor.

[750]
The pole cannot be raised further.

[751]
The pole cannot be lowered further.

[752]
The pole is lowered into the channel.

[753]
The pole is lowered into the stone hole.

[754]
The pole is already resting on the floor.

[755]
The pole now rests on the stone floor.

[756]
The button becomes depressed.

[757]
The button pops back out.

[758]
The button is already depressed.

[759]
No doubt you have a bottle of moonbeams as well.

[760]
The beam is now interrupted by a # lying on the floor.

[761]
You can't break the beam with a #.

[762]
The # already breaks the beam.

[763]
I see no bronze door here.

[764]
The bronze door opens.

[765]
The bronze door closes.

[766]
On the other size of the door is a narrow passage which opens out
into a larger area.

[767]
The door won't budge.

[768]
The knock reverberates along the hall.  For a time it seems there
will be no answer.  Then you hear someone unlatching the small wooden
panel.  Through the bars of the great door, the wrinkled face of an
old man appears.  He gazes down at you and intones as follows:
   "I am the master of the dungeon, whose task it is to insure
that none but the most scholarly and masterful adventurers are
admitted into the secret realms of the dungeon.  To ascertain whether
you meet the stringent requirements laid down by the Great
Implementers, I will ask three questions which should be easy for
one of your reputed excellence to answer.  You have undoubtedly
discovered the answers during your travels through the dungeon.
Should you answer each of these questions correctly within five
attempts, then I am obliged to acknowledge your skill and daring and
admit you to these regions.
   "All answers should be in the form 'ANSWER "answer"'."

[769]
The booming voice asks:

[770]
"From which room can one enter the robber's hideaway without passing
through the cyclops room?"

[771]
"Beside the Temple, to which room is it possible to go from the Altar?"

[772]
"What is the absolute minimum specified value of the Zorkmid
treasures, in Zorkmids?"

[773]
"What object is of use in determining the function of the iced cakes?"

[774]
"What can be done to the mirror that is useful?"

[775]
"The taking of which object offends the ghosts?"

[776]
"What object in the dungeon is haunted?"

[777]
"In which room is the phrase 'Hello sailor' useful?"

[778]
The door is securely fastened.

[779]
The wooden door opens.

[780]
The wooden door closes.

[781]
The dungeon master says, "I will stay."

[782]
The dungeon master says, "I will follow."

[783]
There is no reply.

[784]
"I prefer to stay where I am, thank you."

[785]
"I am not permitted to enter the prison cell."

[786]
"I cannot perform that action for you."

[787]
This gives you the rank of Dungeon Master.

[788]
This gives you the rank of Super Cheater.

[789]
This gives you the rank of Master Cheater.

[790]
This gives you the rank of Advanced Cheater.

[791]
This gives you the rank of Cheater.

[792]
This is the Tomb of the Unknown Implementer.  A hollow voice
says, "That's not a bug, it's a feature!"
In the north wall of the room is the Crypt of the Implementers.  It
is made of the finest marble and is apparently large enough for four
headless corpses.  The crypt is #.  Above the entrance is the
cryptic inscription:

  "Feel Free".

To the south is a small opening, apparently of recent origin.

[793]
The door of the crypt is extremely heavy, but it opens easily.

[794]
The crypt is already open.

[795]
The crypt is already closed.

[796]
The crypt is closed.

[797]
The dial spins and comes to a stop pointing at "#".

[798]
There is no answer.

[799]
No one seems to be listening.

[800]
The dungeon master says, "Excellent."

[801]
The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have four more chances."

[802]
The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have three more chances."

[803]
The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have two more chances."

[804]
The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have one more chance."

[805]
The mirror is closed.

[806]
You must specify what to set the dial to.

[807]
The dial face contains only numbers.

[808]
The dial now points to "#".

[809]
The button depresses with a slight click and pops back.

[810]
The cell door is now closed.

[811]
You notice that the dungeon master does not follow.

[812]
The dungeon master catches up with you.

[813]
The dungeon master follows you.

[814]
There is a wooden wall blocking your way.

[815]
There is a large mirror blocking your way.

[816]
There is a large broken mirror blocking your way.

[817]
The structure blocks your way.

[818]
As you leave, the door swings shut.

[819]
This is a narrow room whose west wall is a large mirror.

[820]
This is a narrow room whose east wall is a large mirror.

[821]
This is a narrow room whose west wall is a large wooden panel
which once contained a mirror.

[822]
This is a narrow room whose east wall is a large wooden panel
which once contained a mirror.

[823]
The mirror is mounted on a panel which has been opened outward.

[824]
The panel has been opened outward.

[825]
The opposite wall is solid rock.

[826]
The dungeon master says, "You are wrong."  The dungeon master,
obviously disappointed in your lack of knowledge, shakes his head
and mumbles, "I guess they'll let anyone in the dungeon these days."
With that, he departs.

[827]
The dungeon master, obviously pleased, says, "You are indeed a
master of lore.  I am proud to be at your service."  The massive
wooden door swings open, and the master motions for you to enter.

[828]
Saves are not permitted during the endgame.

[829]
Restores are not permitted during the endgame.

[830]
The structure rotates clockwise.

[831]
The structure rotates counterclockwise.

[832]
I see no mirror here.

[833]
I don't see a way to open the mirror here.

[834]
The mirror breaks, revealing a wooden panel behind it.

[835]
The mirror has already been broken.

[836]
The mirror is mounted on a wooden panel which moves slightly inward
as you push and back out as you let go.  The mirror feels fragile.

[837]
The mirror is unyielding but seems rather fragile.

[838]
I see no panel here.

[839]
I don't see a way to open the panel here.

[840]
To break the panel you would have to break the mirror first.

[841]
The panel is not that easily destroyed.

[842]
The wooden panel moves slightly inward as you push and back out
when you let go.

[843]
The panel is unyielding.

[844]
A disheveled adventurer stares back at you.

[845]
The mirror is broken into little pieces.

[846]
Shards of a broken mirror are dangerous to play with.

[847]
The # side of the room is divided by a wooden wall into small

[848]
hallways to the #east and #west.

[849]
A large mirror fills the # side of the hallway.

[850]
A large panel fills the # side of the hallway.

[851]
The shattered pieces of a mirror cover the floor.

[852]
The corridor continues north.

[853]
The corridor continues south.

[854]
The corridor continues north and south.

[855]
Incantations are useless once you have gotten this far.

[856]
That incantation seems to have been a failure.

[857]
Sorry, only one incantation to a customer.

[858]
That spell has no obvious effect.

[859]
As the last syllable of your spell fades into silence, darkness
envelops you, and the earth shakes briefly.  Then all is quiet.

[860]
The structure won't budge.

[861]
This is a room with an exit to the north and a metal door to the east.

[862]
This is a room with an exit to the north and a passage to the east.

[863]
The card slides easily into the slot and vanishes, and the metal
door slides open, revealing a passageway to the west.  A moment
later, a previously unseen sign flashes:
 "Unauthorized/Illegal Use of Pass Card -- Card Confiscated"

[864]
The item vanishes into the slot.  A moment later, a previously
unseen sign flashes "Garbage In, Garbage Out".  The #,
now atomized, spews through the slot.

[865]
I can't see any ladder here.

[866]
Come, come!

[867]
You hit your head on the ceiling and fall off the ladder.

[868]
This is a small square room bounded to the north and west with
marble walls and to the east and south with sandstone walls.

[869]
It appears the thief was correct.

[870]
In the ceiling above you is a large circular opening.

[871]
The center of the floor here is noticeably depressed.

[872]
The west wall here has a large steel door at its center.  On one side
of the door is a small slit.

[873]
The west wall here has a large opening at its center.  On one side
of the opening in a small slit.

[874]
There is a ladder here, firmly attached to the east wall.

[875]
There is a ladder here, firmly attached to the west wall.

[876]
There is only a passage in that direction.

[877]
The wall does not budge.

[878]
The wall slides forward and you follow it.
The architecture of this region is getting complex, so that further
descriptions will be diagrams of the immediate vicinity in a 3x3
grid.  The walls here are rock, but of two different types - sandstone
and marble.  The following notations will be used:
   ..  = current position (middle of grid)
   MM  = marble wall
   SS  = sandstone wall
   ??  = unknown (blocked by walls).

[879]
The wall slides forward and you follow it to this position:

[880]
Your position is as follows:

[881]
The exit is too far above your head.

[882]
With the help of the ladder, you exit the puzzle.

[883]
Don't be lazy, type the command yourself.

[884]
In the MDL sources, NOOBJ is described as a "hack".  As we are
above such practices, NOOBJ is not implemented.

[885]
The grating closes.

[886]
This gives you the rank of Nebish.

[887]
Moving the # reveals nothing.

[888]
The # pays no attention.

[889]
There isn't enough room in the #.

[890]
Going up empty-handed is a bad idea.

[891]
The troll's axe seems white hot.  You can't hold on to it.

[892]
It was just here a minute ago...

[893]
It seems to be to the southwest.

[894]
You're not at the house.

[895]
It's right in front of you.  Are you blind?

[896]
The house is a beautiful colonial house which is painted white.  It
is clear that the previous owners must have been extremely wealthy.

[897]
You must be joking.

[898]
I can't see how to get in from here.

[899]
The window is closed.

[900]
Your burn your hand as you attempt to extinguish the flame.

[901]
How singularly useless.

[902]
The # does not understand this.

[903]
It smells like a #.

[904]
That's not very useful.

[905]
You probably put spinach in your gas tank, too.

[906]
Hmm.  It appears that the tube contained glue, not oil.  Turning the
bolt won't get any easier...

[907]
The chests are all empty.

[908]
The chests are fastened to the wall.

[909]
The tube is closed.

[910]
The tube is apparently empty.

[911]
The viscous material oozes into your hand.

[912]
"Do you think I'm as stupid as my father?" he says, dodging.

[913]
Feature.

[914]
That's right.

[915]
The thief seems to have left you in the dark.

[916]
I see no granite wall here.

[917]
There is no granite wall here.

[918]
The north wall is solid granite here.

[919]
You can't tie the rope to yourself.

[920]
You cannot move the barrel.

[921]
You are inside a barrel.  Congratulations.  Etched into the side of
the barrel is the word "Geronimo!".  From your position, you cannot
see the falls.

[922]
The barrel is damp and cannot be burned.

[923]
You can't take it; thus, you can't shake it!

[924]
You shovel cannot dig into the ground here.

[925]
You watch the balloon explode after hitting the rim; its tattered
remains land on the ground by your feet.

[926]
The rope is tied to a #.

[927]
"That certainly wasn't what I had in mind," he says, and disappears.

[928]
The bucket is fireproof and won't burn.

[929]
The leak is too high above you to reach.

[930]
"Whirr, buzz, click!"

[931]
"Surely you jest", he says.  He tosses the brick over his should and
disappears with an understated "pop".

[932]
The metal door bars the way.

[933]
Very good.  The violin is now worthless.

[934]
An amazingly offensive noise issues from the violin.

[935]
You are so engrossed in the role of the # that you kill
yourself, just as he would have done!

[936]
There is a # here.

[937]
No one is listening.

[938]
A whispering voice replies, "Water makes the bucket go."
Unfortunately, wishing makes the coins go...

[939]
The # is now sitting at the bottom of the well.

[940]
That doesn't make sense.

[941]
Why would you send for the #?

[942]
The mailing label on this glossy brochure from MIT Tech reads

  Intrepid Adventurer
  c/o Local Dungeon Master
  White House, GUE

From the Introduction:

The brochure describes, for the edification of the prospective
student, the stringent but wide-ranging curriculum of MIT Tech.
Required courses are offered in Ambition, Distraction, Uglification,
and Derision.  The Humanities are not slighted at this institution,
as the student may register for Reeling and Writhing, Mystery
(Ancient and Modern), Seaography, and Drawling (which includes
Stretching and Fainting in Coils).  Advanced students are expected
to learn Laughing and Grief.

                                 William Barton Flathead, Founder

(The brochure continues in this vein for a few hundred more pages.)

[943]
Affixed loosely to the brochure is a small stamp.

[944]
It's probably on the way.

[945]
Why?  Do you need another one?

[946]
What do you want to say to the #?

[947]
Ok, but you know the postal service...

[948]
There is a knocking sound from the front of the house.

[949]
All such attacks are vain in your position.

[950]
Even such a simple action is beyond your capabilities.

[951]
You need no light to guide you.

[952]
How can you think of your score in your condition?

[953]
No one can hear you.

[954]
You hand passes through its object.

[955]
You have no possessions.

[956]
You are dead.

[957]
The room looks strange and unearthly.

[958]
The room looks strange and unearthly, and objects appear indistinct.

[959]
Although there is no light, the room seems dimly illuminated.

[960]
Your prayers are not heard.

[961]
The rope is fastened to a #.

[962]
You cannot enter in your condition.

[963]
You can't even do that.

[964]
I don't enjoy leading crazies through the dungeon.

[965]
The # eludes you.

[966]
You can't go that way.

[967]
The bell suddenly becomes white hot and falls to the ground.  The
wraiths, as though paralyzed, stop their jeering and slowly turn to
face you.  On their ashen faces, the expression of a long-forgotten
terror takes shape.

[968]
In your confusion, the candles drop to the ground and go out.

[969]
The flames flicker wildly and appear to dance.  The earth beneath
your feet trembles, and your legs nearly buckle beneath you.  The
spirits cower at your unearthly power.

[970]
The tension of your ceremony is broken, and the wraiths, amused but
shaken at your clumsy attempt, resume their hideous jeering.

[971]
The bell appears to have cooled down.

[972]
The bell is very hot and cannot be taken.

[973]
The bell is too hot to reach.

[974]
The # burns and is consumed.

[975]
The heat from the bell is too intense.

[976]
The water cools the bell and is evaporated.

[977]
The waters enters but cannot stop the # from burning.

[978]
The water evaporates before it can get close.

[979]
The # is extinguished.

[980]
The water spills over the # and to the floor, where it evaporates.

[981]
You can't pour that on anything.

[982]
There is not enough room under this door.

[983]
The mat easily fits under the door.

[984]
As the mat is removed, a # falls from it onto the floor.

[985]
The lid is open.

[986]
The keyhole is occupied.

[987]
The lid covers the keyhole.

[988]
No light can be seen though the keyhole.

[989]
You can barely make out a lighted room at the other end.

[990]
The lid is in the way.

[991]
The keyhole is blocked.

[992]
There is a faint noise from behind the door, and a small cloud of
dust arises from beneath it.

[993]
The # doesn't fit.

[994]
The intense heat of the stove keeps you away.

[995]
The welcome mat is under the door.

[996]
The door is now unlocked.

[997]
It can't be unlocked with that.

[998]
These are apparently the wrong keys.

[999]
It can't be locked with that.

[1000]
The door is locked.

[1001]
The paper is very small and vanishes under the door.

[1002]
The door is now open.

[1003]
The door is now closed.

[1004]
Perhaps if you were diced...

[1005]
The door is open, dummy.

[1006]
What do you think is suspending you in mid air?

[1007]
You tumble down the chute to the cellar.

[1008]
It's not easy to play with the rope in your position.

[1009]
The rope comes loose as you take the #.

[1010]
You tumble down the slide...

[1011]
The # falls down the slide and is gone.

[1012]
This is a small chamber, which appears to have been part of a
coal mine.  On the south wall of the chamber the letters "Granite
Wall" are etched into the rock.  To the east is a long passage,
and there is a steep metal slide twisting downward.  To the north
is a small opening.

[1013]
A # is lying on the ground here.  Tied to it is a piece
of rope, which is dangling down the slide.

[1014]
As you descend, you realize that the rope is slippery from the
grime of the coal chute and that your grasp will not last long.

[1015]
This is a small and rather dreary room, which is eerily illuminated
by a red glow emanating from a crack in one of the walls.  The light
appears to focus on a dusty wooden table in the center of the room.

[1016]
This is a tiny room, which has an exit to the east.

[1017]
On the # side of the room is a massive wooden door, near the
top of which, in the center, is a window barred with iron.  A
formidable bolt lock is set within the door frame.  A keyhole

[1018]
lies within the lock.

[1019]
covered by a thin metal lid lies within the lock.

[1020]
A # is in place within the keyhole.

[1021]
The edge of a welcome mat is visible under the door.

[1022]
Lying on the mat is a #.

[1023]
You see only darkness.

[1024]
As you peer into the sphere, a strange vision takes shape of
a distant room, which can be clearly described...

[1025]
It is too clumsy when you are carrying it.

[1026]
An astonished adventurer is staring into a crystal sphere.

[1027]
The vision fades, revealing only an ordinary crystal sphere.

[1028]
The # was not well braced and falls through the hole
after you, nearly cracking your skull.

[1029]
It's not really tied, but...

[1030]
The coil of rope is tied to the wooden timber.

[1031]
The coil of rope is tied to Ramses II's gold coffin.

[1032]
There is a wooden timber on the ground here.

[1033]
The solid gold coffin used for the burial of Ramses II is here.

[1034]
The rope slips from your grasp and you tumble down into the cellar.

[1035]
I see nothing special about the #.

[1036]
I can't see anything.

[1037]
You can't do that.

[1038]
It's not in that.

[1039]
The window is barred.

[1040]
The window is already closed.

[1041]
The grating is closed.

[1042]
The door is open.

[1043]
The lid falls to cover the keyhole.

[1044]
You must perform the ceremony.

[1045]
You suddenly notice that the # has vanished.

[1046]
Too many substrings.

[1047]
Misplaced comma.

[1048]
Too many words.

[1049]
Misplaced comma or conjunction.

[1050]
  A #, which contains:

[1051]
    A #.

[1052]
That spell doesn't appear to have done anything useful.

[1053]
Your collection of treasures consists of:

[1054]
The # doesn't contain anything.

[1055]
Your swing misses the # by an inch.

[1056]
A mightly blow, but it misses the # by a mile.

[1057]

[1060]
Your sword crashes down, knocking the # into dreamland.

[1061]

[1062]
A furious exchange, and the # is knocked out.

[1070]

[1072]

[1074]

[1075]

[1087]
The # takes a final blow and slumps to the floor dead.

[1092]

[1094]
Slash!  Your stroke connects!  The # could be in serious trouble!

[1095]
The # drops to his knees, staggered.

[1096]
The # is confused and can't fight back.

[1097]

to his livelihood.
