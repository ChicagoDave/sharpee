# World Model Extraction - Summary

## Completed Work

### 1. Created World Model Package ✅
- Extracted all world model components from stdlib into a separate package
- Set up proper package structure with TypeScript configuration
- Removed all dependencies on stdlib (no circular dependencies)

### 2. Implemented Trait-Behavior Architecture ✅
All traits now follow the pattern of:
- **Traits**: Pure data containers with validation only
- **Behaviors**: Static methods for all logic

Completed traits and behaviors:
- ✅ ContainerTrait + ContainerBehavior
- ✅ IdentityTrait + IdentityBehavior  
- ✅ RoomTrait + RoomBehavior
- ✅ SceneryTrait + SceneryBehavior
- ✅ WearableTrait + WearableBehavior
- ✅ ReadableTrait + ReadableBehavior
- ✅ LightSourceTrait + LightSourceBehavior
- ✅ ExitTrait + ExitBehavior
- ✅ EntryTrait + EntryBehavior
- ✅ OpenableTrait + OpenableBehavior
- ✅ LockableTrait + LockableBehavior
- ✅ SupporterTrait + SupporterBehavior
- ✅ SwitchableTrait + SwitchableBehavior
- ✅ EdibleTrait + EdibleBehavior

### 3. Updated All Core Actions in StdLib ✅
Fixed imports and converted to static behavior pattern:
- ✅ takingAction - uses Container, Scenery, Wearable behaviors
- ✅ droppingAction - uses Container, Supporter, Wearable behaviors
- ✅ examiningAction - uses Identity, Container, Openable, etc.
- ✅ lookingAction - uses Room behavior
- ✅ goingAction - uses Room, Exit behaviors (door handling TODO)
- ✅ openingAction - uses Openable, Lockable behaviors
- ✅ closingAction - uses Openable behavior
- ✅ wearingAction - uses Wearable behavior  
- ✅ inventoryAction - uses Wearable behavior

### 4. Architecture Benefits Achieved
- **Clean separation**: World-model has zero dependencies on stdlib
- **Single responsibility**: Traits hold data, behaviors hold logic
- **No instantiation**: All behaviors use static methods
- **Reusable**: World-model can be used by any IF system, not just stdlib
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support with proper exports

## What's Left

### Near-term
1. Update remaining actions (unlocking, removing, etc.)
2. Run build and fix any remaining import issues
3. Add missing traits when needed (NPCTrait, DialogueTrait, PlayerTrait, DoorTrait)

### Longer-term  
1. Consider event typing strategy without coupling to stdlib
2. Add world model services (query services, etc.)
3. Optimize performance if needed

## Key Decisions Made
- Use string literals for events to avoid coupling
- Static methods for all behaviors (no instantiation)
- Keep traits minimal - just data and validation
- Export everything through package index for clean imports
