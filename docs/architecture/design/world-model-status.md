# World Model Extraction - Status Update

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Created World Model Package
- ✅ Set up package structure with proper dependencies
- ✅ Moved all entity classes (IFEntity, EntityStore)
- ✅ Moved all trait folders from stdlib
- ✅ Created base Behavior class

### 2. Fixed Key Issues
- ✅ Updated imports to use @sharpee/core instead of relative paths
- ✅ Removed circular dependencies to stdlib
- ✅ Converted behaviors to static methods (WearableBehavior, SceneryBehavior)
- ✅ Replaced event constants with string literals

### 3. Current State of Traits

#### Working Traits (data + behavior):
- ✅ ContainerTrait + ContainerBehavior
- ✅ IdentityTrait + IdentityBehavior
- ✅ RoomTrait + RoomBehavior
- ✅ SceneryTrait + SceneryBehavior  
- ✅ WearableTrait + WearableBehavior
- ✅ ReadableTrait + ReadableBehavior
- ✅ LightSourceTrait + LightSourceBehavior
- ✅ ExitTrait + ExitBehavior
- ✅ EntryTrait + EntryBehavior

#### All Core Traits Completed:
- ✅ OpenableTrait + OpenableBehavior
- ✅ LockableTrait + LockableBehavior
- ✅ SupporterTrait + SupporterBehavior
- ✅ SwitchableTrait + SwitchableBehavior
- ✅ EdibleTrait + EdibleBehavior

#### Missing Traits (referenced but not implemented):
- ❌ NPCTrait
- ❌ DialogueTrait
- ❌ PlayerTrait
- ❌ DoorTrait

## Next Steps

### 1. Update Actions in StdLib ✅
- ✅ takingAction.ts - already updated to use static behaviors
- ✅ droppingAction.ts - updated to use static behaviors 
- ✅ examiningAction.ts - updated to use static behaviors
- ✅ lookingAction.ts - updated to use static behaviors
- ✅ goingAction.ts - updated (door handling commented out)
- ✅ openingAction.ts - updated (door handling commented out)

### 2. Minimal Working Set ✅
Core actions are now updated:
- ✅ take (uses Container, Scenery, Wearable)
- ✅ drop (uses Container, Supporter, Wearable) 
- ✅ examine (uses Identity, Container, Openable, etc.)
- ✅ look (uses Room, Identity)
- ✅ go (uses Room, Exit) 
- ✅ open (uses Openable, Lockable)

### 3. Event System
Currently using string literals for events ('if.action.failed', etc.)
Decision: Keep as strings for now to avoid coupling

### 4. All Core Behaviors Completed ✅
All behaviors have been converted to static pattern:
- ✅ OpenableBehavior 
- ✅ LockableBehavior
- ✅ SupporterBehavior
- ✅ SwitchableBehavior
- ✅ EdibleBehavior

### 5. Remaining Work
- Test the build and fix any remaining import issues
- Update remaining actions (closing, unlocking, wearing, etc.)
- Implement missing traits (NPCTrait, DialogueTrait, PlayerTrait, DoorTrait)
- Add proper event typing without coupling to stdlib

## Architecture Benefits

The separation is working well:
- World-model has no dependencies on stdlib
- Clear data/logic separation within world-model
- Actions in stdlib can use world-model as a clean API
- No circular dependencies

## Recommendation

1. Get takingAction fully working as proof of concept
2. Then systematically update other actions
3. Add missing behaviors as needed
4. Defer advanced traits (NPC, Dialogue) until core is stable
