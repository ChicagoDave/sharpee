You're right - let's focus on the design document first. I'll help you develop a comprehensive design document for your parser-based IF story based on the screenplay and backstory you've provided.

# REFLECTIONS: Interactive Fiction Design Document

## Description of the World

In our world, certain individuals possess supernatural abilities known as "The Blood" - hereditary powers passed down through bloodlines. These powers are named after elements (Silver, Moon, Earth, Light, etc.) and grant specific abilities. Those with these powers exist in a secretive society that has developed its own culture, traditions, and feuds over centuries.

### People of this World

- **The Blooded**: Individuals who possess supernatural abilities
- **Silver Blooded**: Those with the ability to travel through mirrors and create connections between them
- **Moon Blooded**: Those with the power of invisibility
- **Earth Blooded**: The rarest bloodline, with powers of regeneration and communion with nature
- **Light Blooded**: Those with abilities to manipulate light (rare)
- **Regular Humans**: Unaware of the existence of the Blooded

### Society of the Blooded

- Secretive and insular, operating in hidden enclaves
- Organized loosely by bloodlines with traditional alliances and rivalries
- Maintain strict rules about exposure to regular humans
- Possess their own justice system and customs for resolving disputes
- Many believe certain bloodlines (like Earth and Light) have been eradicated in ancient feuds

## The Powers ("Blood of...")

- **Blood of the Silver**: 
  - Mirror travel and transportation
  - Remote viewing through mirrors
  - Sensing/tracking others who have used mirrors
  - Creating permanent connections between mirrors

- **Blood of the Moon**:
  - Invisibility
  - Enhanced stealth abilities
  - Shadow manipulation

- **Blood of the Earth**:
  - Regeneration/healing
  - Communication with natural elements
  - Survival in harsh conditions

- **Blood of the Light**:
  - Light manipulation
  - Illumination in darkness
  - Creating illusions

## Recent History

Twenty years ago, the Thief (a Silver Blood) married Katherine (an Earth Blood, though neither knew of her ability). During a robbery gone wrong, Katherine was shot and appeared to die in the Thief's arms. Her father, the Old Man (also a Silver Blood), swore vengeance on the Thief, believing he had gotten his daughter killed. Unknown to both men, Katherine survived due to her dormant Earth Blood powers, crawled from her grave months later, and gave birth to a daughter, the Young Woman, who possesses both Silver and Earth Blood abilities.

## Money

The Blooded use regular human currency but also have a system of favors and debts within their society. Certain services and information can only be obtained through these non-monetary exchanges.

## Common Expressions/Colloquialisms

- "Through the glass" - to travel via mirrors
- "Marking a mirror" - leaving a trace for others to follow
- "Silver sight" - the ability to detect other mirrors
- "The long reflection" - death
- "Tracing blood" - identifying someone's power lineage
- "Glass ties" - connections between Blooded families

## Prologue

The game opens with the Thief, in a state of depression over the loss of his wife two decades ago, executing an art heist at the Chicago Art Institute. Wearing a highly reflective suit (which ironically makes him more detectable to other Silver Bloods), he steals a valuable painting. Unknown to him, this act will bring him back into contact with his past and the family he thought was gone forever.

## Story Synopsis

### Chapter 1: The Heist (PC: The Thief)
The Thief, using his mirror-traveling abilities, breaks into the Chicago Art Institute and steals a valuable painting. The security system is triggered, forcing a hasty escape. Upon returning to his apartment, he discovers the painting has been stolen from him.

### Chapter 2: The Hunter (PC: The Old Man)
The Old Man, having detected the Thief's activities through his distinctive reflective suit, follows his trail and steals the painting. He makes contact with the "family" (Blooded organization) to confirm his kill order on the Thief.

### Chapter 3: The Observer (PC: The Young Woman)
The Young Woman has been watching both men, trying to understand their connection to her past. She follows the Old Man to a bordello that serves as a neutral ground for the Blooded and learns more about the feud between him and the Thief.

### Chapter 4: On the Run (PC: The Thief)
The Thief realizes he's being hunted and attempts to secure resources by breaking into a bank vault. He sets traps using adhesive on mirrors to catch his pursuer.

### Chapter 5: The Confrontation (PC: The Old Man)
The Old Man tracks the Thief to a hotel but falls into his trap, becoming stuck in the adhesive-covered mirror. He is captured by the Thief who questions him about his motives.

### Chapter 6: The Revelation (PC: The Young Woman)
The Young Woman intervenes in the confrontation between the Thief and the Old Man. She reveals her identity as the daughter of both Katherine and the Thief, explaining that her mother survived and possesses the Blood of the Earth.

### Chapter 7: Reunion or Tragedy (Multiple PCs)
The final chapter plays out differently based on player choices throughout the game. Optimal ending: the family reconciles and goes to find Katherine. Tragic endings: one or more characters die in the confrontation.

## Design Notes

- The game should maintain the cinematic quality of the screenplay while adding interactive depth
- Each PC should have a distinctly different feel and set of abilities
- Mirror puzzles should be varied and not repetitive
- Emotional storytelling should be prioritized alongside puzzle-solving
- Character motivations and relationships should evolve based on player choices
- Visual descriptions of mirror travel should be vivid and distinctive
- The Portals extension provides excellent technical foundation for implementation

Would you like me to expand on any particular section of this design document? For example, I could develop more detailed puzzles, flesh out specific locations, or create more detailed character backgrounds.
