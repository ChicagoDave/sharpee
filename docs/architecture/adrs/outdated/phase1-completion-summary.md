# Phase 1 Completion Summary

## Completed Core World Model Traits

### 1. Enhanced Identity Trait
- Added physical properties: weight, volume, size
- Added getter methods in IdentityBehavior
- Added validation for size values

### 2. Container Trait
- Created complete trait with capacity constraints (weight, volume, items)
- Added transparency and enterable flags
- Added type restrictions (allowed/excluded types)
- Implemented full ContainerBehavior with:
  - canAccept validation
  - Capacity checking
  - Weight and volume calculations
  - Remaining capacity queries

### 3. Supporter Trait  
- Created trait with weight and item capacity
- Added enterable flag for sit/stand functionality
- Added type restrictions
- Implemented SupporterBehavior with:
  - canAccept validation
  - Capacity checking
  - Total weight calculation (includes nested contents)

### 4. Enhanced Room Trait
- Updated exits to support door references:
  ```typescript
  exits: { [direction: string]: { destination: string; via?: string; } }
  ```
- Added lighting properties:
  - baseLight (inherent room lighting)
  - isOutdoors (affected by time of day)
  - isUnderground (never has natural light)
- Updated RoomBehavior with:
  - Exit management methods
  - Total light calculation
  - Light source contribution
  - Darkness detection

### 5. Door Trait
- Created trait connecting two rooms
- Supports one-way doors (bidirectional flag)
- Implemented DoorBehavior with:
  - Room connection queries
  - Traversal validation
  - Direction checking

### 6. LightSource Trait
- Created trait with brightness and fuel tracking
- Supports both unlimited and consumable light sources
- Implemented LightSourceBehavior with:
  - Light/extinguish controls
  - Fuel consumption and refueling
  - Fuel percentage calculations

## Architecture Maintained
- All traits are pure data structures
- All behaviors use static methods only
- Clean separation between data and logic
- No hardcoded strings or language
- Proper trait type registration

## Next Steps
- Add comprehensive tests for all traits
- Move to Phase 2: World Model Interface Implementation
- Update StdLib actions to use new traits
