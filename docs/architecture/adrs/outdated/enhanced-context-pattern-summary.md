# Enhanced Context Pattern Migration - Work Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated all 45 standard actions in the Sharpee IF engine to use the Enhanced Context Pattern, achieving complete separation of logic and text.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Infrastructure Development
- **Enhanced Context Interface** (`enhanced-types.ts`): Created new action interface with `requiredMessages` array for compile-time message validation
- **Enhanced Action Context** (`enhanced-context.ts`): Implemented context wrapper with helper methods:
  - `emitSuccess(messageId, params)` - Emits success events with message IDs
  - `emitError(messageId, params)` - Emits error events with message IDs  
  - `emit(eventType, data)` - General event emission
  - Automatic message ID resolution (short to full form)

### 2. Action Migration (100% Complete)
Migrated all 45 standard actions across 7 categories:

#### Core Actions (6)
- taking, dropping, looking, inventory, examining, going

#### Container Actions (5)  
- opening, closing, putting, inserting, removing

#### Wearable Actions (2)
- wearing, taking-off

#### Lock Actions (2)
- locking, unlocking

#### Movement Actions (3)
- entering, exiting, climbing

#### Sensory Actions (5)
- searching, listening, smelling, touching, switching-on

#### Device Actions (5)
- switching-off, pushing, pulling, turning

#### Social Actions (6)
- giving, showing, talking, asking, telling, answering

#### Interaction Actions (5)
- throwing, using, eating, drinking, attacking

#### Meta Actions (6)
- waiting, scoring, help, about, saving, restoring, quitting

### 3. Language Separation
Created corresponding language files for all 45 actions in `lang-en-us` package:
- Each action has its own language file with patterns, messages, and help text
- All human-readable content moved to language files
- Actions contain zero hardcoded strings

### 4. Key Architectural Improvements

#### Before:
```typescript
return "You can't take that.";
```

#### After:
```typescript
context.emitError('cant_take', { object: target });
// Resolves to: 'if.action.taking.cant_take'
// Language provider returns: "You can't take {object}."
```

### 5. Benefits Achieved
- **Complete Separation**: Logic and text are 100% separated
- **Multi-language Ready**: Easy to add new languages without touching action code
- **Maintainable**: Changes to messages don't require action modifications
- **Testable**: Actions can be tested without language dependencies
- **Type-Safe**: Required messages are validated at compile time

## Migration Statistics
- **Files Modified**: 45 action files + 45 language files = 90 files
- **Messages Extracted**: ~300+ unique messages across all actions
- **Patterns Preserved**: All original command patterns maintained
- **Backward Compatibility**: Full compatibility through adapter layer

## Technical Details

### Message ID Convention
- Action ID: `if.action.{actionName}`
- Message ID: `{actionId}.{messageKey}`
- Example: `if.action.taking.taken`

### Event Structure
```typescript
{
  type: 'action.success',
  data: {
    actionId: 'if.action.taking',
    messageId: 'taken',
    params: { object: 'sword' }
  }
}
```

### Required Infrastructure
1. Enhanced context implementation
2. Language provider with getMessage support
3. Text service that resolves message IDs
4. Event system that preserves message data

## Next Steps Completed
- ✅ Text service updated to resolve message IDs
- ✅ Language provider enhanced with getMessage
- ✅ Parameter substitution implemented
- ✅ Integration tests created
- ✅ Full system validation

## Conclusion
The Enhanced Context Pattern migration is complete and fully operational. All standard actions now use message IDs instead of hardcoded text, enabling true internationalization and clean separation of concerns.
