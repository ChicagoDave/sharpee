# Text Service Implementation - Work Summary

## Overview
Successfully extracted text generation from the game engine into a separate, extensible text service architecture with query-based design and turn history recording.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Core Text Service Package (`@sharpee/text-service`)
Created foundational package with interfaces and base implementations:

#### Interfaces
- **TextService**: Main service interface with query-based design
- **TextServiceDependencies**: Injectable dependencies (eventSource, worldModel, etc.)
- **TextChannel**: Output channel abstraction
- **IFLanguageProvider**: Language provider interface with getMessage
- **TurnHistory & QueryRecord**: Query recording interfaces
- **EventSource, WorldModel, SpatialIndex**: Query interfaces

#### Implementations
- **BaseTextService**: Abstract base class with automatic query recording
- **TextServiceRegistry**: Service registration and management
- **InMemoryTurnHistoryStore**: Turn history storage (with pruning)
- **Channel Implementations**: Buffered, Console, Multi, Callback, Filtering, Transforming

### 2. Basic Text Service Package (`@sharpee/text-service-basic`)
Created standard text service implementation:

#### Features
- Message ID resolution from Enhanced Context Pattern
- Parameter substitution with entity name resolution
- Backward compatibility with direct text
- Special event handling (locations, inventory, etc.)
- Configurable output (debug, filtering, etc.)

#### Configuration Options
```typescript
{
  showEventTypes?: boolean;      // Include event types in output
  debug?: boolean;               // Show debug information
  includeSystemEvents?: boolean; // Process system events
  filterEventTypes?: string[];   // Filter specific event types
  showMissingMessages?: boolean; // Show missing message warnings
}
```

### 3. Engine Integration
Updated game engine to use new text service:

#### Adapters Created
- **EngineEventSourceAdapter**: Tracks events by turn
- **WorldModelAdapter**: Provides entity queries
- **SpatialIndexAdapter**: Spatial relationship queries
- **LanguageProviderAdapter**: Bridges old/new language providers

#### New Engine Methods
- `getTextOutput()`: Retrieve generated text
- `getTextService()`: Access text service instance
- `setTextService()`: Use custom text service

### 4. Language Provider Enhancement
Enhanced `lang-en-us` package:
- Implemented `getMessage(messageId, params)` interface
- Loads all action messages from language files
- Supports parameter substitution
- Maintains backward compatibility

### 5. Query-Based Architecture

#### Turn Processing Flow
1. Engine completes turn â†’ all state changes done
2. Engine calls `textService.processTurn(turnNumber)`
3. Text service queries event source for turn events
4. For each event, queries entities and spatial data
5. Resolves message IDs and substitutes parameters
6. Records all queries in turn history
7. Returns generated text

#### Query Recording
Every query is recorded with:
- Query type (event, entity, spatial, relation)
- Query parameters
- Query results
- Timestamp
- Source system

### 6. Testing Infrastructure
Created comprehensive testing with real implementations:

#### Test Implementations
- **TestEventSource**: Full event tracking and filtering
- **TestWorldModel**: Entity management with traits
- **TestSpatialIndex**: Spatial relationship queries
- **TestLanguageProvider**: Message resolution
- **Helper Functions**: World creation, scenarios, assertions

#### Test Coverage
- Message ID resolution
- Parameter substitution  
- Query recording verification
- Turn history analysis
- Backward compatibility
- Enhanced Context Pattern integration
- End-to-end scenarios

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Text generation completely separate from game logic
- Text service runs after all world changes complete
- No text generation during event processing

### 2. Extensibility
- Easy to create custom text services
- Registry pattern for multiple implementations
- Different styles (verbose, terse, narrative)
- Community can contribute text services

### 3. Debugging & Analysis
- All queries recorded for analysis
- Can replay text generation
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Understand data access patterns

### 4. Multi-Language Support
- Integrates with Enhanced Context Pattern
- Message IDs instead of hardcoded text
- Language provider handles localization
- Parameter substitution built-in

## Technical Architecture

### Package Structure
```
@sharpee/text-service        # Core interfaces and base
@sharpee/text-service-basic  # Standard implementation  
@sharpee/engine              # Updated to use text service
@sharpee/lang-en-us         # Enhanced with getMessage
```

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Query-Based**: Pull model instead of push
2. **Turn History**: All queries recorded (ADR-029)
3. **Separate Package**: Enables independent development
4. **Real Test Implementations**: Better than mocks

## Statistics
- **Lines of Code**: ~3,500 across all packages
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive with real implementations
- **Interfaces Created**: 15+ core interfaces
- **Channel Types**: 6 different implementations
- **Query Types**: 4 (event, entity, spatial, relation)

## Performance Considerations
- Query recording adds minimal overhead
- Turn history can be disabled for production
- In-memory store prunes old turns
- Efficient parameter substitution

## Migration Impact
- Clean migration path provided
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Existing games continue to work
- New features opt-in

## Conclusion
The text service refactoring successfully extracts text generation into a modular, extensible system. The query-based architecture with turn history provides powerful debugging capabilities while maintaining clean separation between game logic and text presentation. The implementation is production-ready with comprehensive testing and documentation.
