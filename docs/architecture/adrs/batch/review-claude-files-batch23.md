# Sharpee Architecture Decisions - Batch 23

## File: 2025-05-22-15-00-17.json
**Topic**: Reviewing Sharpee Codebase and Status

### Decision: Package Structure Organization

**Context**: Project review showed the current package structure.

**Decision**: 
The project is organized into the following packages:
- `@sharpee/core` - Core engine functionality
- `@sharpee/lang-en-us` - English language implementation
- `@sharpee/stdlib` - Standard command handlers
- `@sharpee/forge` - Author layer for story creation
- `@sharpee/client-core` - Client core functionality (React template)
- Extensions: `conversation`, `mirrors` - Extension packages

**Rationale**: Clear separation of concerns with modular packages that can be independently versioned and maintained.

### Decision: Parser Refactoring Phase 3 Completion

**Context**: Status update from April 21, 2025 (22:30) showing Phase 3 of parser refactoring completed.

**Decision**: Successfully migrated all English-specific parser components:
1. **Tokenizer** - `EnglishTokenizer` with support for contractions and compound verbs
2. **POS Tagger and Dictionaries** - Migrated parts-of-speech tagging functionality
3. **Phrase Identifier** - Identifies verb, noun, and prepositional phrases
4. **Grammar Analyzer** - Extracts commands from phrases
5. **Lemmatizer** - Handles English word forms with customizable rules

**Rationale**: This completes the separation of language-specific parser components from core engine logic, enabling language extensibility.

### Decision: Customizable Parser Architecture

**Context**: Need to allow authors to customize parsing behavior.

**Decision**: Implemented two-tier parser provider system:
- `EnglishParserProvider` - Base implementation
- `CustomizableEnglishParserProvider` - Author-specific customizations

**Rationale**: Authors can now customize parsing behavior for their specific needs without modifying core components.

### Decision: Language Provider Integration

**Context**: Parser system needs to work seamlessly with language provider system.

**Decision**: 
- Enhanced `EnglishLanguageProvider` to include parser provider
- Connected with `CustomizableEnglishProvider` for seamless integration
- Added comprehensive tests for integration

**Rationale**: Provides a unified language system that handles both text generation and parsing.

### Decision: Next Phase Focus

**Context**: With Phase 3 complete, need to determine next steps.

**Decision**: Phase 4 will involve:
1. Updating command handlers to work with the new parser system
2. Creating examples of how authors can customize language and parsing behavior
3. Documenting the language extension system for future maintainers

**Rationale**: This ensures the new parser system is properly integrated and documented for use.

### Decision: Architecture Benefits Achieved

**Context**: Assessment of the refactored parser architecture.

**Decision**: The refactored architecture provides:
1. **Clean Separation** - Language-specific parser components isolated from core
2. **Extensibility** - Authors can customize parsing behavior
3. **Maintainability** - Components are cohesive and focused
4. **Testability** - Each component can be tested independently

**Rationale**: These benefits align with the project's goals of creating a flexible, maintainable IF engine.

### Decision: Missing Components Identified

**Context**: Review identified several planned but not yet implemented components.

**Decision**: The following components are listed in workspaces but not present:
- Web client implementation (React template exists but not built)
- CLI package
- Dev tools package
- Story examples in the stories directory

**Rationale**: These represent future work items that are planned but not yet prioritized.

## Implementation Status

As of the review date (May 22, 2025):
- Core package with world-model foundation established
- Event system with channels implemented
- Rules system with builders completed
- Parser system refactored (Phase 3 complete)
- Language system with `@sharpee/lang-en-us` package
- Standard library with basic command handlers
- Forge package for author tools

## Key Architectural Highlights

1. **Channel System**: Implemented with MAIN and detailed sub-channels (NPC-ACTIVITY, ITEM-DROPPED, etc.)
2. **Event System**: Event source pattern with TextEmitter for output
3. **Language Templates**: Support for templated output like "You dropped {0}."
4. **Modular Design**: Clear separation between core, language-specific components, and author tools
