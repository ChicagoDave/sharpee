# Sharpee Architecture Decisions - Batch 27

## File: 2025-05-22-21-11-37.json
**Topic**: Work Continuity Issue and World Model Progress

### Decision: Work Continuity Protocol

**Context**: Claude Desktop bug was erasing conversations, causing loss of work context.

**Decision**: 
Established a protocol for checking existing work before proceeding:
1. Check recently modified files in packages/core/src/world-model/
2. Look for new IF-specific files or types
3. Check for new test files related to world model
4. Look for partial implementations or TODOs
5. Review ROADMAP.md and status files after May 22, 2025

**Rationale**: Due to conversation loss, need to avoid duplicating work or losing progress. This systematic check ensures continuity.

### Status: World Model Simplification Started

**Context**: The message indicates work had already begun on world model simplification but extent was unknown due to chat loss.

**Decision**: 
World model simplification was in progress (ðŸš§) with unknown completion level.

**Rationale**: The simplified world model with IF-specific concepts was identified as the next major task after parser completion.

### Reconfirmed Project Goals

The message reconfirms the key project goals:
- Fluent API for non-programmer authors
- Graph-based world model (keep this concept)
- Separate text emission from game logic
- Multi-language support
- Pattern-based parser (not NLP)
- TypeScript implementation

### Development Issue Identified

**Context**: Claude Desktop bug causing conversation erasure.

**Impact**: 
- Loss of work context
- Uncertainty about completed work
- Need for careful review before proceeding

This highlights the importance of:
1. Regular status documentation
2. Clear file organization
3. TODO markers in code
4. Incremental commits
