## Architectural Decisions Found

### File 1: 2025-06-15-21-47-38.json - Refactor Status Review

#### Decision: Core Package Structure Finalized
- **Context**: Reviewing TypeScript errors after major refactor
- **Decision**: Core package structure confirmed with only 2 remaining errors
- **Details**:
  - Core successfully cleaned of IF-specific code
  - Parser moved to stdlib
  - World Model moved to stdlib
  - IF-specific constants moved to stdlib
  - Core now contains only generic components

#### Decision: Error Resolution Strategy
- **Context**: Two TypeScript compilation errors identified
- **Decision**: Fix errors in-place rather than reverting changes
- **Details**:
  1. Remove non-existent `./types` export from index.ts
  2. Add type checking for `payload.itemId` to ensure string type

### File 2: 2025-06-15-22-15-10.json - Refactor Audit

#### Decision: Archive Organization Complete
- **Context**: Auditing what's been moved and what remains
- **Decision**: Most cleanup complete with specific remaining items identified
- **Details**:
  - No test files found in active directories
  - Parser implementations already archived
  - World model backups already cleaned
  - 3 migration scripts still need archiving

#### Decision: Stdlib Implementation Priority
- **Context**: IF-specific modules in archive need porting
- **Decision**: Prioritize porting critical execution components
- **Details**:
  - Game context system → needs stdlib implementation
  - Command router and handler → needs stdlib implementation
  - Enhanced text processor → needs stdlib implementation
  - Message builder/resolver → needs stdlib implementation
  - IF-specific language support → needs stdlib implementation

### File 3: 2025-06-15-22-25-30.json - Architecture Review

#### Decision: Core Principles Assessment
- **Context**: Deep assessment of platform state against core principles
- **Decision**: Acknowledge partial success but identify critical gaps
- **Status**:
  1. **Query-able World Model**: ✅ Partially Met
  2. **No Virtual Machine**: ✅ Met
  3. **Multiple Language Hooks**: ✅ Partially Met
  4. **Event-Driven Text System**: ❌ Not Met
  5. **Fluent Author Layer**: ❌ Not Met
  6. **Standard Library Balance**: ✅ Partially Met

#### Decision: ExecutionContext Abstraction Needed
- **Context**: Core still has IF-specific awareness
- **Decision**: Make ExecutionContext truly generic
- **Details**: Move TextService and LanguageProvider references to stdlib's GameContext

#### Decision: Forge Layer Development Priority
- **Context**: Author-facing API minimal and not fluent
- **Decision**: Implement fluent API pattern for Forge
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  story()
    .room('kitchen', 'A cozy kitchen')
    .item('knife', 'A sharp knife')
    .rule(when.taking('knife').say('Careful!'))
  ```

#### Decision: Critical Path to Functionality
- **Context**: Platform cannot execute basic IF game
- **Decision**: Focus on restoring command execution pipeline
- **Priority Order**:
  1. Clean Core's dist folder
  2. Port GameContext to StdLib
  3. Port Command Router/Handler
  4. Abstract ExecutionContext

## Summary

This batch reveals the successful completion of the core/stdlib separation refactor, with Core now largely IF-agnostic. However, critical execution components remain in archive and need to be properly ported to stdlib. The assessment identifies that while structural separation is achieved, the platform is currently non-functional for running IF games.

Key architectural gaps identified:
- Event-driven text system not fully implemented
- Fluent author layer (Forge) underdeveloped
- Command execution pipeline broken

The decisions focus on immediate restoration of functionality while maintaining architectural purity.
