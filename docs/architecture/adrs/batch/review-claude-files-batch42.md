### File: 2025-06-17-16-13-27.json - Channel System Architecture Review

**Decision: Simplify/Remove the Channel System**

**Context:**
- The channel system was designed to categorize events and format them into text output
- It sits between the event system and text generation  
- After standardizing action handlers to be purely event-based (no text generation), the team realized channels might be unnecessary

**Key Points:**

1. **Current Issues:**
   - Channel system is not integrated with the rest of the architecture
   - IFWorld uses its own EventEmitter instead of Core's EventSource
   - No connection between world events and channel output
   - Adds unnecessary complexity

2. **New Understanding:**
   - Action handlers only emit events (no text)
   - Text generation should happen through templates
   - Channels are an unnecessary middle layer

3. **Proposed Simplification:**
   ```
   Actions → Events → Text Service (with templates) → Output
   ```
   Instead of:
   ```
   Actions → Events → Channels → Text Service → Output
   ```

4. **Benefits of Removal:**
   - Simpler architecture
   - More flexible template system  
   - Clearer responsibilities
   - Less code
   - Better alignment with "no virtual machine" principle

**Quote from discussion:**
> "Having solidified the action handlers (there is no text at all, only events going to the event source) I see the channel system is likely unnecessary"

**Impact:**
This represents a significant architectural simplification, removing an entire abstraction layer that was deemed unnecessary once the event-based design was fully implemented.
