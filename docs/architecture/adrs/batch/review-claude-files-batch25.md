# Sharpee Architecture Decisions - Batch 25

## File: 2025-05-22-21-03-16.json
**Topic**: TypeScript Interactive Fiction Platform - Tool Preference

### Decision: Tool Preference Change

**Context**: Previous work may have been done with filesystem tool.

**Decision**: 
Preference stated to use desktop_commander instead of filesystem for future work.

**Rationale**: Not explicitly stated, but likely relates to different capabilities or interface preferences between the tools.

### Status Confirmation

This chat reconfirms the same status and priorities from the previous chat:
- ‚úÖ Core architecture (channels, events) - keeping these
- ‚úÖ New IF-specific parser with pattern matching and disambiguation
- üöß Need to simplify world model with IF-specific concepts
- ‚è≥ Need to implement the Forge authoring layer

The key goals and next task remain unchanged from the previous session.

## Note

This file contains minimal new architectural decisions as it appears to be a session restart with the same context as the previous chat. The main addition is the tool preference for desktop_commander.
