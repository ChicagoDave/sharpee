# Batch 36: Claude Chat Review - Standard Actions Implementation

## File: 2025-05-27-21-30-12.json
**Title**: "Implementing Standard Game Actions"
**Date**: May 27, 2025

### Summary
This conversation focused on implementing all the standard game actions for Sharpee, following the established action system architecture. The implementation demonstrates consistent patterns and comprehensive validation.

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### 1. Action Implementation Pattern
Each action follows a consistent structure:
- Uses `StandardActions` enum for ID and name (no hardcoded strings)
- Defines triggering verbs array
- Includes reversibility metadata
- Implements validate and execute phases
- Emits semantic events (never generates text directly)

#### 2. Validation Strategy
Comprehensive validation in each action:
- Presence checks (must have target)
- Self-reference prevention (can't take yourself)
- State validation (already open, already locked)
- Attribute requirements (openable, lockable, container)
- Accessibility checks
- Special requirements (key for locking)

#### 3. Language System Integration
All user-facing strings use the language system:
```typescript
context.languageProvider.getMessage('action.taking.already_held', {
  item: target.attributes.name || 'that'
}) || `You're already carrying ${target.attributes.name || 'that'}.`
```
- Message keys follow naming convention
- Fallback strings provided
- Parameters passed for interpolation

#### 4. Event-Driven Output
Actions emit semantic events with metadata:
```typescript
createEvent(
  constants.events.ITEM_TAKEN,
  { 
    itemId: targetId,
    itemName: target.attributes.name,
    from: currentLocation
  },
  { 
    actor: command.actor,
    location: context.currentLocation.id,
    narrate: true
  }
)
```

#### 5. World State Updates
Immutable state pattern for all modifications:
```typescript
const newContext = context.updateWorldState(state => {
  const newState = { ...state };
  // Update entities
  return newState;
});
```

#### 6. Container/Supporter Handling
Special logic for putting objects in/on things:
- Distinguishes between containers and supporters
- Validates preposition usage ("in" vs "on")
- Checks if containers are open
- Prevents circular containment

#### 7. Key-Based Security
Locking/unlocking actions support key requirements:
- Optional `keyId` attribute on lockable objects
- Validates key presence in inventory
- Includes key information in events

### Actions Implemented
1. **Opening**: Open containers and doors
2. **Closing**: Close containers and doors
3. **Locking**: Lock with optional key requirement
4. **Unlocking**: Unlock with optional key requirement
5. **Putting**: Put objects in/on containers
6. **Giving**: Give objects to NPCs
7. **Using**: Generic use/activate action
8. **Talking**: Basic communication
9. **Asking/Telling**: Directed communication

### Technical Patterns

#### Error Prevention
- Early validation prevents invalid states
- Clear error messages for each failure case
- Consistent reason codes for programmatic handling

#### Extensibility
- Metadata system allows custom properties
- Rule system can intercept any phase
- Language messages can be customized per game

#### Performance
- Minimal world state traversal
- Efficient relationship updates
- Single state update per action

### Integration Points
- Works with existing parser system
- Uses world model relationships
- Integrates with event system
- Compatible with rule system

### Next Steps Mentioned
- Additional standard actions (showing, wearing, eating)
- Advanced features (save/restore, undo/redo)
- Forge author layer
- Web client template

## Significance
This implementation establishes the pattern for all game actions in Sharpee. The consistent structure, comprehensive validation, and event-driven architecture ensure that new actions can be added easily while maintaining quality and consistency. The separation of logic from text output through the event system is a key architectural win.
