# Claude Chat History Review - Batch 48

## Files Reviewed

### 1. /chat-history/claude/2025-06-20-13-17-42.json
**Title: World Model Package Migration**

#### Major Architecture Decisions Found:

1. **Three-layer architecture separation**:
   - Core Layer (`/packages/core`): IF-agnostic data store only
   - StdLib Layer (`/packages/stdlib`): IF implementation  
   - Forge Layer (`/packages/forge`): Author API
   - **Critical principle**: NEVER import StdLib concepts into Core. Core knows nothing about IF.

2. **Trait-Behavior-Action Architecture**:
   - **Traits = Pure Data** (no methods except getters/setters)
   - **Behaviors = Logic** (static methods, required traits)
   - **Actions = Command Processors** (parsing rules separated from execution)

3. **Language Separation**: 
   - NO hardcoded strings in actions or behaviors
   - Use `ActionFailureReason` enum for failures
   - All text comes from `lang-en-us` package
   - Verbs defined in language package, not commands

4. **Event System Architecture**:
   - All text is sent through events to an event source data store (in-memory)
   - After a turn is completed (all world model changes are completed), a text service uses templates and language service to emit formatted text
   - Actions return semantic events with data, not text
   - Example: `return [createEvent(IFEvents.TAKEN, { item, actor })]` NOT `return "You take the lamp."`

5. **World Model Extraction**:
   - Moved all entity classes (IFEntity, EntityStore) to world-model package
   - Moved all trait folders from stdlib
   - Created base Behavior class
   - Converted behaviors to static methods
   - Replaced event constants with string literals

6. **IF Conventions**:
   - Objects are **takeable by default** (use SceneryTrait to prevent)
   - Scope queries belong in world model, not action config
   - Simple is better - don't overcomplicate

**Title: World Model Final Checklist Phase 1**

This file primarily contains implementation work following the architecture decisions from the previous file. No new major architecture decisions were found.

## Summary

The key architectural decisions for the Sharpee IF Platform revolve around:
1. Clean separation of concerns with a three-layer architecture
2. Data/logic separation via Traits and Behaviors
3. Semantic event-driven system for all text output
4. Language independence through separation of text from logic
5. Extension-ready design with world-model as a standalone package
