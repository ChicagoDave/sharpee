## Key Architecture Decisions Found

### From 2025-06-19-19-54-54.json: Closing Action Command Definition

**Context**: Cleaning up build errors from traits and actions implementation.

**Architecture Decisions**:

1. **Action System Structure**:
   - Actions implement the `ActionExecutor` interface with `id` and `execute` method
   - Commands are separated from actions - `CommandDefinition` maps verbs to actions
   - Actions return `SemanticEvent[]` for text service processing
   - No hardcoded strings - use enums for failure reasons

2. **Module Organization**:
   - Created centralized `actions.ts` to export all actions and commands
   - Actions organized in folders: `/actions/closing/`, `/actions/opening/`, etc.
   - Each action folder contains both command definition and action executor

3. **Import Boundaries**:
   - All core imports go through `core-imports.ts` - no direct `@sharpee/core` imports
   - Relative imports for local files within stdlib
   - Clear separation between command parsing and action execution

### From 2025-06-19-21-48-23.json: Interactive Traits Design Review

**Context**: Professional IF designer assessment of the trait system implementation.

**Major Architecture Decisions**:

1. **Traits to Remove**:
   - **LightSensitiveTrait** - Overengineering, handle with room descriptions
   - **ValuableTrait** - Just data, should be property on IdentityTrait
   - **MerchantTrait** - Too specific, use DialogueTrait + behaviors
   - **ScriptableTrait** - Security risk, breaks trait/behavior separation

2. **Missing Critical IF Patterns**:
   - **EntryTrait** - For enterable objects (chairs, vehicles)
   - **ExitTrait** - For room connections (not just directions)
   - **GrammarTrait** - For natural language generation

3. **Room/Exit Architecture Evolution**:
   - Initial: Rooms as entities with RoomTrait
   - Evolved: Recognition that IF worlds are graphs
   - Discussion of Neo4j-like graph model for relationships
   - Exits can be arbitrary (not just compass directions) - e.g., "xyzzy"
   - Everything queryable should be an entity (including exits)

4. **Graph vs ECS Pattern**:
   - Acknowledged previous move from graph-first to ECS pattern
   - Recognition that ECS with relationships forms implicit graph
   - "Best of both worlds" - queryable entities that form graph structures

5. **Design Principles Established**:
   - If it's just data, it belongs in IdentityTrait
   - If it's rarely used, don't make it a trait
   - If traits always appear together, merge them
   - Follow IF conventions religiously
   - Traits represent interaction patterns, not just properties

6. **Trait Organization**:
   - Standard traits in own folders (identity/, container/, etc.)
   - Some interactive traits in folders, some grouped in /interactive/
   - All traits in StdLib, not Core (correct architecture)
   - Mixed organization indicates need for cleanup

## Architectural Implications

1. **Queryability is Paramount**: Everything important enough to query should be an entity
2. **Graph Structure**: IF worlds naturally form graphs through entity relationships
3. **Lean Trait System**: Remove over-engineered traits, focus on 90% use cases
4. **Clear Separation**: Traits are data, behaviors are logic, actions are executors

## Next Steps Indicated

1. Remove identified unnecessary traits
2. Implement missing critical traits (Entry, Exit, Grammar)
3. Consider refactoring to explicit graph model for room connections
4. Merge traits that always appear together (Lockable + Openable)
