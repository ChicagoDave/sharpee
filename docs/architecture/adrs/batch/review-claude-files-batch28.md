# Sharpee Architecture Decisions - Batch 28

## File: 2025-05-24-19-04-02.json
**Topic**: Enhanced Work Continuity Protocol

### Decision: Improved Documentation Protocol

**Context**: Due to Claude Desktop bug erasing conversations, needed a more robust documentation approach.

**Decision**: 
Enhanced the work continuity protocol with immediate file-based documentation:
1. **FIRST** - Create a status-check-[timestamp].md file
2. **Check areas systematically**:
   - packages/core/src/world-model/ for IF-specific files
   - New test files for world model
   - ROADMAP.md for updates
   - Status files after May 22, 2025
   - TODO files or partial implementations
3. **Document immediately** - Update status file after EACH check (not at the end)
4. **Summary last** - Only provide summary after everything is written to file

**Rationale**: By writing findings to a file immediately after each check, work is preserved even if the conversation is lost. This prevents loss of investigation work.

### Decision: Investigation Before Implementation

**Context**: Uncertainty about existing work due to conversation loss.

**Decision**: 
Explicit directive: "Do not start any implementation work - just investigate and document."

**Rationale**: Prevents duplicate work and ensures understanding of current state before proceeding with new implementation.

### Refined Project Goals

**Context**: Slight refinement in how project goals are expressed.

**Decision**: 
Key goal refined to: "Graph-based world model with IF-specific concepts" (combining two previous goals)

**Rationale**: This clarifies that the graph-based approach is retained but with IF-specific concepts rather than generic abstractions.

### Process Improvement

This represents a maturation of the development process in response to technical challenges:
- **Version 1**: Basic work check (previous chat)
- **Version 2**: Immediate file-based documentation with step-by-step updates

The enhanced protocol shows:
1. Learning from technical issues
2. Adapting processes for resilience
3. Prioritizing work preservation
4. Clear separation of investigation and implementation phases

## Impact

This protocol change affects how all future work sessions should begin:
1. Create timestamped status file
2. Document findings immediately
3. Preserve work incrementally
4. Summarize only after documentation is complete
