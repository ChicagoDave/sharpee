# Claude Files 71-80 Architecture Review

## File 71: Refactoring Text to Language Class (2024-08-26-01-06-10)
**Architectural Decisions:**
- Introduced Language namespace with language-specific classes (EnUs)
- Created template constants for all emitted text
- Added LanguageAttribute to tag language classes with standard codes
- Created LanguageManager for dynamic language loading
- Used reflection-based language switching
- Created LanguageKeys class for type-safe constant references

**Final Architecture Impact:**
- Partially aligns with final Text Service using templates
- Language separation concept carried forward
- Dynamic loading approach differs from final event-driven text generation

## File 72: Updating TakeAction with Language Capabilities (2024-08-26-01-18-39)
**Architectural Decisions:**
- Extended language constants to multiple action handlers
- Consistent pattern for language key usage across actions
- Maintained separation between game logic and text output

**Final Architecture Impact:**
- Reinforces text separation principle
- Pattern of externalizing strings carried forward to template system

## Summary

**Decisions that became part of final architecture:**
1. Separation of text from game logic (evolved into Text Service)
2. Template-based text generation concept
3. Language/locale support infrastructure

**Decisions that were changed:**
1. Reflection-based language switching → Event-driven text generation
2. Static language classes → Dynamic template system
3. Direct LanguageManager calls → Post-turn text processing

**Dead ends to avoid:**
1. Reflection-heavy language switching
2. Tight coupling between actions and language manager
3. Static constant-based text storage

**Key Insight:**
This batch shows the early evolution of text handling, which eventually led to the event-driven Text Service. The core principle of separating text from logic was established here, though the implementation approach changed significantly.
