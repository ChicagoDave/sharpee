# Sharpee Deep Assessment - June 15, 2025

## Executive Summary

The Sharpee refactor has made significant progress toward the three-layer architecture (Core/StdLib/Forge). The Core package has been successfully stripped of most IF-specific code, with parser and world model now residing in StdLib. However, several issues remain that prevent the architecture from being fully aligned with the stated principles.

## Current Architecture State

### ✅ What's Working Well

1. **Layer Separation Progress**
   - Parser successfully moved from Core to StdLib
   - World model successfully moved from Core to StdLib
   - IF-specific constants moved to StdLib
   - Standard actions (16 total) moved to StdLib with language system integration
   - Core exports are now mostly generic

2. **Core Package State**
   - Contains only generic systems: events, channels, extensions, rules, language, types
   - No parser dependencies
   - No world model dependencies
   - Generic execution types (no GameContext)

3. **StdLib Implementation**
   - Parser fully implemented with language support
   - World model (IFWorld) properly implemented
   - All 16 standard actions migrated and working
   - Language system with English provider
   - Message system for internationalization

### ⚠️ Critical Issues

1. **Core Still Contains IF Remnants**
   - `/dist` folder has compiled parser/world-model/languages code
   - `/dist/stdlib-old` directory exists
   - Empty `/src/story` directory
   - `trigger-delete.ts` placeholder file
   - Legacy test file `test-language.ts` in dist

2. **Architectural Violations**
   - Core's index.ts references parser/world-model in comments but doesn't export them
   - ExecutionContext in Core knows about TextService and LanguageProvider (IF concepts?)
   - Constants in Core still include some IF-specific concepts (entity types, relationships)

3. **Missing Implementations**
   - Game context system (archived but not in StdLib)
   - Command router/handler (archived but not in StdLib)
   - Enhanced text processor (archived but not in StdLib)
   - Message builder/resolver (archived but not in StdLib)
   - IF-specific language support (archived but not in StdLib)

4. **Build System Issues**
   - Dist folders contain outdated compiled code
   - No clean separation between build artifacts
   - Missing proper build scripts for the three-layer architecture

## Gap Analysis

### Core Package
| Component | Current State | Target State | Gap |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|-----|
| Parser | ❌ Still in dist | ✅ None | Need to clean dist |
| World Model | ❌ Still in dist | ✅ None | Need to clean dist |
| IF Constants | ⚠️ Some remain | ✅ Only generic | Need further cleanup |
| Execution | ⚠️ IF-aware types | ✅ Generic only | Needs abstraction |
| Events | ✅ Generic | ✅ Generic | None |
| Channels | ✅ Generic | ✅ Generic | None |
| Extensions | ✅ Generic | ✅ Generic | None |
| Rules | ✅ Generic | ✅ Generic | None |

### StdLib Package
| Component | Current State | Target State | Gap |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|-----|
| Parser | ✅ Implemented | ✅ Full IF parser | None |
| World Model | ✅ Implemented | ✅ IFWorld | None |
| Actions | ✅ 16 actions | ✅ Standard actions | None |
| Game Context | ❌ Missing | ✅ Full context | Port from archive |
| Command Router | ❌ Missing | ✅ Router system | Port from archive |
| Text Processing | ❌ Missing | ✅ Enhanced processor | Port from archive |
| Messages | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ Full i18n | Needs enhancement |

### Forge Package
| Component | Current State | Target State | Gap |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|-----|
| Story Builder | ⚠️ Basic stub | ✅ Fluent API | Needs implementation |
| Room/Item API | ❌ Missing | ✅ Author-friendly | Needs implementation |
| Templates | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ Rich templates | Needs enhancement |
| Documentation | ⚠️ Minimal | ✅ Comprehensive | Needs examples |

## Violation of Core Principles

1. **"Core must remain IF-agnostic"**
   - ❌ ExecutionContext knows about game concepts
   - ❌ Constants include IF-specific types
   - ❌ Dist contains IF code

2. **"No virtual machine"**
   - ✅ Direct TypeScript execution maintained

3. **"Event-sourced text"**
   - ⚠️ System exists but enhanced processor not ported

4. **"Fluent author layer"**
   - ❌ Forge is minimal, not fluent

5. **"Standard library with moderate complexity"**
   - ⚠️ Missing key components (game context, command routing)

## Immediate Action Items

### 1. Clean Core Package (Priority: HIGH)
```bash
# Remove all dist folders and rebuild
rm -rf packages/core/dist
rm -rf packages/core/src/story
rm packages/core/src/trigger-delete.ts

# Update tsconfig to exclude old files
# Rebuild with clean output
```

### 2. Port Missing Components to StdLib (Priority: HIGH)
- [ ] Game Context from `archive/core-game-context.ts`
- [ ] Command Router from `archive/core-command-router.ts`
- [ ] Command Handler from `archive/core-command-handler.ts`
- [ ] Enhanced Text Processor from `archive/core-enhanced-text-processor.ts`
- [ ] Message Builder from `archive/core-message-builder.ts`
- [ ] Message Resolver from `archive/core-message-resolver.ts`

### 3. Abstract Core Interfaces (Priority: MEDIUM)
- [ ] Make ExecutionContext truly generic
- [ ] Remove IF-specific constants from Core
- [ ] Create pure data interfaces

### 4. Implement Forge Properly (Priority: MEDIUM)
- [ ] Design fluent API for story authoring
- [ ] Implement room/item/character builders
- [ ] Create comprehensive examples
- [ ] Write author-focused documentation

### 5. Documentation & Build (Priority: LOW)
- [ ] Update all package READMEs
- [ ] Create architecture diagram
- [ ] Set up proper build pipeline
- [ ] Add integration tests

## Recommended Next Session Focus

1. **Clean Core Distribution**
   - Delete all compiled IF code from dist
   - Remove empty directories
   - Rebuild with strict boundaries

2. **Port Game Context System**
   - This is the most critical missing piece
   - Required for command execution
   - Blocks other components

3. **Verify Layer Boundaries**
   - Audit all imports
   - Ensure no upward dependencies
   - Add linting rules to enforce

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Core builds with zero IF-specific code
- [ ] StdLib provides complete IF implementation
- [ ] Forge enables simple story creation
- [ ] Clear import boundaries enforced
- [ ] All tests pass with new architecture

## Conclusion

The refactor has successfully separated the parser and world model, which was the primary goal. However, to fully realize the three-layer architecture vision, we need to:

1. Complete the Core cleanup
2. Port the remaining execution components to StdLib
3. Build out Forge as a true author-friendly API
4. Enforce architectural boundaries through tooling

The foundation is solid, but the building is incomplete. The next phase should focus on finishing the StdLib implementation and creating a compelling Forge API that demonstrates the power of this architecture.
