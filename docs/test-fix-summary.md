# Test Fix Summary

## Completed Fixes:
1. ✅ Fixed WorldModel to allow entities in rooms and actors
2. ✅ Fixed test-utils trait addition bug
3. ✅ Fixed examining self to include targetId/targetName
4. ✅ Fixed asking action distance check
5. ✅ Fixed inserting action command structure
6. ✅ Fixed searching test NOT_REACHABLE trait
7. ✅ Added findEntityByName helper

## Remaining Issues:

### 1. Location Still Shows as Actor ID
The core issue is that `getContainingRoom` is returning null/undefined in many cases. This causes the fallback to use player as currentLocation.

**Root Cause**: Even though we fixed `canMoveEntity`, the actual room trait might need to be a container as well.

### 2. Unlocking Tests Pattern
Need to update all tests using TestData.withObject to use the returned object instead of findEntityByName.

### 3. Platform Action Tests
These tests aren't setting up a basic world with player, causing "No player set in world model" errors.

### 4. Context World Undefined in Putting
The inserting action creates a modified context but the world property might not be properly passed through.

## Priority Fixes:

### Fix 1: Make rooms proper containers
Rooms should have both ROOM and CONTAINER traits to properly contain entities.

### Fix 2: Update test patterns
Use the object returned by TestData helpers instead of searching for it by name.

### Fix 3: Fix platform action test setup
Use setupBasicWorld() to ensure player is properly set.
