# Story-Based Testing Implementation Progress

## Completed

### 1. Created Test Stories
✅ **minimal-test-story.ts** - Basic world with one room for testing engine lifecycle
✅ **action-test-story.ts** - Custom actions with test helpers for command execution
✅ **complex-world-test-story.ts** - Multiple rooms and objects for world navigation
✅ **event-test-story.ts** - Event logging and inspection helpers
✅ **game-state-test-story.ts** - Stateful objects and save/load testing
✅ **completion-test-story.ts** - Configurable completion conditions
✅ **index.ts** - Exports all test stories

### 2. Refactored Test Files
✅ **setup.ts** - Removed problematic mockLanguageProvider import
✅ **fixtures/index.ts** - Removed old TestStory class
✅ **game-engine.test.ts** - Refactored to use MinimalTestStory
✅ **command-executor.test.ts** - Refactored to use ActionTestStory
✅ **integration.test.ts** - Refactored to use multiple test stories

## Design Decisions

1. **Story-based approach**: Each test story properly implements the Story interface and specifies `language: 'en-us'`, allowing the engine to load the language provider through normal initialization.

2. **Test helpers**: Each story includes specific test helper methods to verify internal state without breaking encapsulation.

3. **No mocking needed**: By using real stories that go through the proper initialization flow, we avoid the module resolution issues that were causing "verbDef.verbs is not iterable" errors.

## Next Steps

1. **Run tests** to verify the refactoring fixes the issues
2. **Check remaining test files** that might need updating:
   - event-sequencer.test.ts
   - text-service.test.ts
   - Other test files in the directory

3. **Verify coverage** meets the 80% threshold

## Benefits Achieved

- ✅ Tests reflect real-world engine usage
- ✅ No module resolution conflicts
- ✅ Better test isolation with focused stories
- ✅ Clearer test intent
- ✅ More maintainable test code
