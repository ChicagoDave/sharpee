# Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Enhanced Context Issues
- **Problem**: The `createEvent` method in `EnhancedActionContext` was trying to access `this.player.id` without checking if `player` exists
- **Fix**: Added null checks for `player`, `currentLocation`, and command objects before accessing their properties

### 2. Missing Room References
- **Problem**: Several test files had references to undefined `room` variable when setting entity locations
- **Fix**: Updated tests to use `TestData.basicSetup()` which properly returns `{ world, player, room }`

### 3. World Model Method Calls
- **Problem**: Actions were calling `context.world.getLocation()` which may not exist in all world implementations
- **Fix**: 
  - Changed to use `context.world.getContainingRoom()` where appropriate
  - Added optional chaining for `getLocation` calls: `context.world.getLocation?.()`

### 4. Undefined currentLocation
- **Problem**: The restarting action tried to access `context.currentLocation.name` without checking if it exists
- **Fix**: Added optional chaining: `context.currentLocation?.name`

## Files Modified

1. **Enhanced Context** (`src/actions/enhanced-context.ts`)
   - Added null checks in `createEvent` method
   - Added validation in `createMockEnhancedContext`

2. **Test Utils** (`tests/test-utils.ts`)
   - Improved `createTestContext` to ensure entities are properly initialized

3. **Actions**:
   - `telling.ts` - Changed to use `getContainingRoom` instead of `getLocation`
   - `using.ts` - Added optional chaining for `getLocation`
   - `switching_off.ts` - Changed to use `getContainingRoom`
   - `switching_on.ts` - Changed to use `getContainingRoom`
   - `restarting.ts` - Added optional chaining for `currentLocation`

4. **Test Files**:
   - `using-golden.test.ts` - Fixed room references
   - `searching-golden.test.ts` - Fixed room reference

## Design Considerations

The main architectural issue was that the actions were making assumptions about the world model interface that weren't guaranteed. The fixes maintain the event-driven architecture while being more defensive about accessing properties that might not exist.

The test setup was also improved to ensure that basic entities (player and room) are always available when creating test contexts.
