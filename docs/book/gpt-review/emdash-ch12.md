# Em-dash review — Chapter 12: Readable Objects & Switchable Devices

Six em-dash occurrences across six lines. Lines 22 and 117 are `##` headings (recast the trait-name gloss dash to a colon). Lines 4, 19, and 51 are prose paragraphs (recast). Line 130 is in-world copy on a radio sticker the player reads (LEAVE).

### 1. Line 4 — opening paragraph (warning sign appositive) — prose
OLD:
A zoo is full of things to read. Brass plaques by the enclosures, a glossy
brochure at the entrance, a yellow warning sign outside the nocturnal exhibit —
each one *says* something the player wants to take in, separate from what it
*looks* like. And tucked on a shelf in the supply room is a battered radio that
clicks on and off but sheds no light at all. This chapter covers two small,
self-contained traits that round out an ordinary world: `ReadableTrait` for
things with words, and `SwitchableTrait` for devices with an on/off state.
