# Sharpee IF Platform Assessment - August 2025
## From an Interactive Fiction Platform Designer Perspective

## Executive Summary
An assessment of Sharpee as an Interactive Fiction platform, evaluated against established IF design principles from Inform 7, TADS 3, Hugo, and the broader 40+ year tradition of parser-based interactive fiction.

---

## 1. World Model Assessment

### 1.1 World Simulation Strengths ✅

#### Entity-Trait System
- **Excellent foundation** - Trait-based composition is proven (TADS 3 uses similar)
- **Good trait coverage**: Containers, Supporters, Wearables, Openables, Lockables
- **Proper containment hierarchy** - Objects know their location, locations know contents
- **Trait interactions** work correctly (closed containers hide contents)

#### Scope System
- **Sophisticated visibility model** - Darkness, opacity, containment all considered
- **Reachability vs visibility** - Correctly distinguishes "can see" from "can touch"
- **Dynamic scope rules** - Can be modified at runtime for puzzles
- **Performance consideration** - May need caching for large worlds

### 1.2 World Model Gaps ⚠️

#### Missing Core IF Concepts
- [ ] **No "everywhere" objects** (like Inform's backdrop)
- [ ] **No regions** for grouping rooms
- [ ] **No scenes/chapters** for narrative structure
- [ ] **No object kinds/classes** (every entity is instance-based)
- [ ] **No property inheritance** from prototypes

#### Physics Simulation
- [ ] **No weight/bulk system** - Can carry infinite items
- [ ] **No liquid simulation** - Can't pour water between containers
- [ ] **No rope/chain mechanics** - No connected objects
- [ ] **No light levels** - Binary dark/light only
- [ ] **No sound propagation** - No "you hear X from the north"

## 2. Parser & Natural Language

### 2.1 Parser Strengths ✅

#### Command Understanding
- **Pattern-based parsing** works well for IF
- **Multi-word verb support** ("pick up", "look at")
- **Adjective support** for disambiguation ("red book" vs "blue book")
- **Preposition handling** ("put book on table")

### 2.2 Parser Critical Gaps ⚠️

#### Essential IF Features Missing
- [ ] **No pronoun support** - Can't say "take it" or "examine them"
- [ ] **No multi-object commands** - Can't say "take all" or "drop all but lamp"
- [ ] **No plural handling** - Can't say "take coins" to take multiple
- [ ] **No implicit actions** - "unlock door" doesn't try to find key
- [ ] **No command buffering** - Can't type ahead during slow actions

#### Disambiguation Issues
- [ ] **No interactive disambiguation** - Doesn't ask "Which book do you mean?"
- [ ] **No scoring for matches** - All matches treated equally
- [ ] **No context from previous commands** - Doesn't prefer recently mentioned items

---

## 3. Action System

### 3.1 Action Implementation ✅

#### Well-Designed Actions
- **40+ standard actions** - Good coverage of IF basics
- **Consistent validate/execute pattern** - Clean separation
- **Semantic events** for outcomes - Enables rich responses
- **Directional movement** with exit validation

### 3.2 Action System Gaps ⚠️

#### Missing IF Patterns
- [ ] **No action interruption** - Can't stop an action mid-execution
- [ ] **No implicit action chains** - "Go to library" doesn't pathfind
- [ ] **No action prerequisites** - "Read book" doesn't open it first
- [ ] **No action synonyms at runtime** - Can't add "grab" as alias for "take"

#### Missing Standard Actions
- [ ] **UNDO** - Critical for puzzle-solving
- [ ] **OOPS** - Correct typos without retyping
- [ ] **VERBOSE/BRIEF/SUPERBRIEF** - Control description detail
- [ ] **NOTIFY ON/OFF** - Control score change notifications
- [ ] **PRONOUNS** - Show what "it" refers to

---

## 4. Narrative & Story Features

### 4.1 Story Support ✅

- **Story metadata** (title, author, version)
- **Custom actions** can be added per story
- **Event handlers** for story-specific logic
- **Save/restore planned** (not implemented)

### 4.2 Critical Narrative Gaps ⚠️

#### Missing IF Narrative Tools
- [ ] **No scenes/chapters** - Can't structure narrative acts
- [ ] **No achievements/milestones** - No built-in progress tracking
- [ ] **No hint system** - Players need help with puzzles
- [ ] **No scoring variations** - Only simple numeric score
- [ ] **No menu-based conversation** - Only simple "talk to"
- [ ] **No knowledge/topic system** - Can't track what player knows

#### Missing Author Tools
- [ ] **No rule books** (Inform 7 style before/instead/after)
- [ ] **No activities** for customizing standard behaviors
- [ ] **No responses table** for customizing messages
- [ ] **No extensions system** for sharing code

## 5. Comparison to Established IF Platforms

### vs Inform 7

| Feature | Inform 7 | Sharpee | Gap Analysis |
|---------|----------|---------|--------------|
| Natural language syntax | ✅ Full | ❌ None | Not needed - TypeScript is fine |
| Rule-based customization | ✅ Extensive | ⚠️ Basic events | Need before/instead/after |
| World model sophistication | ✅ Complete | ⚠️ Good foundation | Missing kinds, relations, scenes |
| Parser completeness | ✅ Full | ❌ Basic | Critical gaps (pronouns, all) |
| Standard library | ✅ Comprehensive | ⚠️ Decent | Missing key actions |
| Extension ecosystem | ✅ Large | ❌ None | Need plugin system |

**Verdict:** Sharpee has 30% of Inform 7's IF capabilities

### vs TADS 3

| Feature | TADS 3 | Sharpee | Gap Analysis |
|---------|---------|---------|--------------|
| Object-oriented model | ✅ Full OOP | ⚠️ Trait-based | Different but viable |
| Parser sophistication | ✅ Advanced | ❌ Basic | Missing disambiguation |
| NPC conversation | ✅ Full system | ❌ None | Major gap |
| Sensory simulation | ✅ Complete | ❌ Basic | Sight only |
| Travel/pathfinding | ✅ Built-in | ❌ None | Players want "go to X" |

**Verdict:** Sharpee has 25% of TADS 3's IF capabilities

### vs Modern Web IF (Adventuron, Gruescript)

| Feature | Modern Web IF | Sharpee | Gap Analysis |
|---------|---------------|---------|--------------|
| Web-native | ✅ | ✅ | Equal |
| Visual editor | ✅ Usually | ❌ None | Need authoring tools |
| Asset pipeline | ✅ Images/sound | ❌ Text only | Modern IF needs media |
| Mobile support | ✅ | ❌ Not tested | Critical for reach |

**Verdict:** Sharpee behind modern web IF platforms

---

## 6. Technical Quality from IF Perspective

### 6.1 Good IF Architecture Decisions ✅

- **World Model as central simulation** - Correct for IF
- **Bidirectional entity relationships** - Necessary for IF
- **Parser-World coupling** - Required for disambiguation
- **Event-driven outcomes** - Enables rich storytelling
- **TypeScript for type safety** - Prevents runtime errors

### 6.2 Questionable Decisions ⚠️

- **No DSL for authors** - Pure TypeScript may intimidate non-programmers
- **No runtime object creation** - Can't create objects during play
- **No prototype inheritance** - Every object defined individually
- **English-only design** - Hard-coded English assumptions

## 9. IF Platform Viability Assessment

### Strengths as IF Platform
- **Modern tech stack** - TypeScript, web-native
- **Good architectural foundation** - Event-driven, trait-based
- **Active development** - Recent commits show progress
- **Clean code structure** - Well-organized packages

### Weaknesses as IF Platform
- **Missing critical IF features** - Pronouns, undo, conversations
- **No author community** - No games, extensions, or tutorials
- **Limited testing** - No large games to prove scalability
- **English-only** - Localization would require major refactoring

### Market Position
- **Not ready for IF authors** - Too many missing features
- **Not ready for players** - Poor user experience
- **Good for learning/experimentation** - Clean codebase to study
- **Potential for future** - With 6-12 months more development

---

## 10. Final Assessment

### As an IF Platform Designer's Verdict:

Sharpee shows **promise but is not yet viable** as an IF platform. It has a solid technical foundation but lacks essential IF features that have been standard since the 1980s. 

**Current State:** Alpha/Prototype
- Suitable for: Technical experiments, learning IF architecture
- Not suitable for: Real IF development, publishing games

**Path to Viability:**
1. **3 months:** Add essential parser features and core actions
2. **6 months:** Complete world model and add narrative tools
3. **9 months:** Build author tools and documentation
4. **12 months:** Develop showcase games and build community

**Recommendation:** 
Continue development with focus on IF essentials before adding advanced features. Study Inform 7 and TADS 3 deeply for proven patterns. Consider partnering with experienced IF authors for guidance.

The platform has good bones but needs significant IF-specific development before it can compete with established platforms or attract serious IF authors.
