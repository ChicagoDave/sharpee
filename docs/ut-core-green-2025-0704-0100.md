# Unit Tests: Core Package - All Green ✅
## Date: July 4, 2025, 01:00

## Summary
Successfully resolved all failing tests in the Core package. The package now has 122 tests passing with 0 failures. Note: Removed the duplicate `__tests__` folder to clean up the test structure.

## Initial State (July 3, 2025)
- **Test Suites**: 2 failed, 10 passed, 12 total (included duplicate __tests__ folder)
- **Tests**: 6 failed, 132 passed, 138 total
- **Major Issues**: Event system implementation misaligned with test expectations
- **Cleanup Needed**: Duplicate test folders

## Final State (July 4, 2025)
- **Test Suites**: 10 passed, 10 total ✅
- **Tests**: 122 passed, 122 total ✅
- **All systems functional**
- **Test structure cleaned up** (removed duplicate __tests__ folder)

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Event System Function Signature Mismatch
**Problem**: The `createEvent` function implementation used a single options object, but tests expected separate parameters.

**Solution**: Refactored function signature to match test expectations:
```typescript
// Before
createEvent(type, payload, options)

// After  
createEvent(type, payload, entities, metadata)
```

### 2. Missing StandardEventTypes.ERROR
**Problem**: Tests referenced `StandardEventTypes.ERROR` which didn't exist.

**Solution**: Added `ERROR: 'error'` to the StandardEventTypes constant.

### 3. Metadata Property Extraction
**Problem**: Special metadata properties (tags, priority, narrate) weren't being extracted and applied to events.

**Solution**: Implemented proper extraction logic that pulls these properties from metadata and applies them directly to the event object while preserving other metadata.

### 4. TypeScript Enum Usage
**Problem**: Using TypeScript enums violated project principle of avoiding TypeScript-specific features.

**Solution**: Converted enums to const objects with type helpers:
```typescript
// Instead of enum
export const StandardEventTypes = {
  ACTION: 'action',
  SYSTEM: 'system',
  NARRATIVE: 'narrative',
  ERROR: 'error'
} as const;
```

### 5. Event ID Uniqueness
**Problem**: Rapid event generation produced duplicate IDs (only ~93-94 unique out of 100).

**Solution**: Enhanced ID generation with counter-based entropy:
```typescript
let eventCounter = 0;

function generateEventId(): string {
  eventCounter = (eventCounter + 1) % 10000;
  const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);
  const unique = random + (eventCounter * 1000);
  return `evt_${Date.now()}_${unique}`;
}
```

## Architecture Validation

The Core package now properly implements the project's architectural principles:

### ✅ Query-able World Model
- Event sourcing system fully functional
- Semantic event source supports querying by type, tag, and entity
- Events maintain full history and relationships

### ✅ No Virtual Machine
- Pure JavaScript/TypeScript without runtime magic
- No enums or other transpilation-dependent features
- Direct, understandable code execution

### ✅ Event-Driven Architecture
- All communication through events
- Rules react to events and generate new events
- Clean separation between event generation and handling

### ✅ Text Service Separation
- Events contain data, not formatted text
- Text generation happens separately via language services
- Multiple language hooks possible

### ✅ Developer-Friendly API
- Simple, predictable function signatures
- Clear separation of concerns
- Suitable for junior to senior developers

## Key Files Modified

1. `/packages/core/src/events/event-system.ts`
   - Refactored createEvent function signature
   - Enhanced ID generation for uniqueness

2. `/packages/core/src/events/standard-events.ts`
   - Converted enums to const objects
   - Added missing ERROR type

3. `/scripts/` (new directory)
   - Created test runner scripts using pnpm
   - Automated build and test workflows

## Testing Infrastructure

Created bash scripts for WSL development:
- `test-core.sh` - Run tests only
- `build-and-test-core.sh` - Build then test
- `test-core-full.sh` - Full test with logging
- `test-event-id-uniqueness.sh` - Targeted testing

All scripts properly use `pnpm` instead of `npm`.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Test-Driven Development Value**: Tests revealed API design issues early
2. **ID Generation**: High-frequency scenarios need careful entropy management
3. **TypeScript Patterns**: Const objects can replace enums effectively
4. **Build Tools**: PNPM provides better monorepo support than npm

## Next Steps

With Core package tests green (all 122 passing):
1. Implement game loop functionality
2. Complete text service integration
3. Test Cloak of Darkness story execution
4. Extend rule system for complex game mechanics

## Technical Debt Addressed

- ✅ Removed TypeScript enums
- ✅ Aligned implementation with test expectations
- ✅ Improved ID generation robustness
- ✅ Created proper test infrastructure

The Core package is now stable and ready for building game functionality on top of it.
