# ADR-014 Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

We successfully implemented the AuthorModel to solve the problem of placing items in closed containers during world setup and testing.

### Key Files Created/Modified:

1. **Created `AuthorModel.ts`**:
   - Location: `/packages/world-model/src/world/AuthorModel.ts`
   - Provides unrestricted world access for authoring and testing
   - Shares the same underlying data with WorldModel
   - Bypasses all validation rules

2. **Modified `WorldModel.ts`**:
   - Added `getDataStore()` method to expose shared data structures
   - Added import for `DataStore` type from AuthorModel

3. **Updated `container-hierarchies.test.ts`**:
   - Fixed the medicine cabinet test using AuthorModel
   - Removed workarounds for closed container population

4. **Created `author-model.test.ts`**:
   - Comprehensive test suite for AuthorModel functionality
   - Tests shared state, unrestricted movement, and event recording

5. **Updated module exports**:
   - Added AuthorModel to world module exports

### How It Works

```typescript
// During setup - use AuthorModel for unrestricted access
const world = new WorldModel();
const author = new AuthorModel(world.getDataStore());

// Create a closed cabinet
const cabinet = author.createEntity('Medicine Cabinet', 'container');
author.setupContainer(cabinet.id, false); // closed

// Place medicine inside - this works even though cabinet is closed!
const medicine = author.createEntity('Aspirin', 'item');
author.moveEntity(medicine.id, cabinet.id);

// During gameplay - use WorldModel with full validation
const player = world.getPlayer();
// This would fail because cabinet is closed:
world.moveEntity(player.id, cabinet.id); // returns false
```

### Key Design Features

1. **Shared State**: Both models operate on the same data
2. **No Validation**: AuthorModel bypasses all rules
3. **Optional Events**: Use `recordEvent: true` to emit author events
4. **Clear Separation**: Different models for different purposes

### Build Fix

Fixed TypeScript error in `connect()` method by properly typing the exits property access.

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for use. Authors can now:
- Set up complex world states without fighting validation rules
- Place items in closed/locked containers
- Create test scenarios more easily
- Load saved games without validation interference
