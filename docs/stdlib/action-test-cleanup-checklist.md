# Action Test Cleanup Checklist

## Goal
Remove scope validation tests from action unit tests since scope validation is now centralized in CommandValidator.

## Tests to Remove
For each action test file, remove tests that check:
- ❌ "should fail when item is not visible"
- ❌ "should fail when item is not reachable"
- ❌ "should fail when target is not visible"
- ❌ "should fail when target is not reachable"
- ❌ Any test that mocks or checks `canSee()` or `canReach()`

## Tests to Keep
- ✅ All precondition checks that are action-specific
- ✅ Tests for missing parameters
- ✅ Tests for wrong entity types
- ✅ Tests for action-specific state checks
- ✅ All successful action tests
- ✅ All event emission tests

## Process for Each File
1. Copy the old file from `/tmp/stdlib-tests-old/unit/actions/`
2. Update imports from `@jest/globals` to `vitest`
3. Update `EnhancedActionContext` to `ActionContext`
4. Remove scope validation tests
5. Ensure all brackets and syntax are correct
6. Run the test to verify it passes
