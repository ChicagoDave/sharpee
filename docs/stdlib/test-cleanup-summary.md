# Test Cleanup Summary

## What We Did

### 1. Removed Scope Validation Tests from Action Tests
- **Removed 23 tests** that were checking scope validation (e.g., "should fail when item is not visible")
- These tests belonged in CommandValidator tests, not action unit tests
- Actions should assume entities are already validated

### 2. Fixed Syntax Errors
- Cleaned up orphaned code left behind by the test removal script
- Fixed malformed test files that had dangling braces and code fragments

## Results

### Before
- **60 failing tests** total
- Mix of scope validation failures and other issues
- Confusion about where validation should happen

### After  
- **39 failing tests** remaining
- Clear separation of concerns
- Action tests now focus on action logic only

### Remaining Failures by Category

1. **Platform Actions (18 tests)**
   - Saving, restoring, quitting, restarting actions
   - These failures are unrelated to scope changes
   - Need separate investigation

2. **Command Validator (9 tests)**
   - Entity resolution and scope validation
   - These are the RIGHT place for scope tests
   - May need updates to match new scope system

3. **Sensory Extensions (7 tests)**
   - Hearing, smell, darkness mechanics
   - Related to scope system implementation
   - Need to verify integration with StandardScopeResolver

4. **Integration Tests (6 tests)**
   - Full flow tests through parser → validator → action
   - May need updates to match new architecture

5. **Witness System (3 tests)**
   - Event emission for witnessing
   - Likely a simple fix for event creation

## Key Insight

The design is correct:
- **CommandValidator** validates scope (among other things)
- **Actions** execute with pre-validated entities
- **Tests** should reflect this separation

This matches the production flow in CommandExecutor:
```typescript
// 1. Parse
const parsed = parser.parse(input);

// 2. Validate (including scope)
const validated = validator.validate(parsed);  

// 3. Execute
const result = action.execute(validated);
```

## Next Steps

1. Fix the remaining test categories one by one
2. Add comprehensive scope tests to CommandValidator
3. Document the testing patterns for future reference
