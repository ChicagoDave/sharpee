const config = {
  features: {
    advancedParser: true,
    debugMode: false,
    experimentalActions: false
  }
};
```

## Experimental Features

Features marked as experimental:
- May change without notice
- Not covered by semantic versioning
- Should not be used in production
- Require explicit opt-in

Enable experimental features:
```typescript
