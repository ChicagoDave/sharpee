# Action Test Fixes - Change Summary

## Initial Problem
- 476 failing tests in the stdlib package
- All tests were failing with similar errors expecting certain fields in event data but getting `undefined`

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Initial Syntax Error
**File**: `packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/going/going.ts`
**Error**: Line 214 - `params` was undefined, should have been `messageParams`
**Fix Applied**: Changed `params: params` to `params: messageParams`

### 2. Main Issue - Missing `actionId` in Success Events
The tests expect all `action.success` and `action.error` events to have this structure:
```typescript
context.event('action.success', {
  actionId: 'if.action.taking',  // This was missing in ALL success events!
  messageId: 'taken',
  params: { item: 'ball' }
})
```

But the success events in all action files were missing the `actionId` field:
```typescript
// What was there:
context.event('action.success', {
  messageId: 'taken',
  params: { item: 'ball' }
})
```

## Attempted Fixes

### 1. First Attempt - Using `this.id`
Added `actionId: this.id` to all success events. This caused a TypeScript build error because:
- In the action object's `execute` method, `this` refers to the action object, so `this.id` works
- In standalone functions (like in `climbing.ts`), `this` has no type annotation and causes TS2683 error

### 2. Second Attempt - Using `context.action.id`
Changed all instances to use `context.action.id` for consistency with error events:
- This should work because `context.action` refers to the current action being executed
- All error events already use `context.action.id`

## Files Modified

### Manual Fixes Applied:
1. **going.ts** - Fixed syntax error (params â†’ messageParams) and added actionId
2. **searching.ts** - Added actionId to 1 success event, fixed 3 error events
3. **taking.ts** - Added actionId to 1 success event
4. **examining.ts** - Added actionId to 2 success events
5. **removing.ts** - Added actionId to 1 success event, fixed 1 error event
6. **drinking.ts** - Added actionId to 1 success event, fixed 1 error event
7. **throwing.ts** - Added actionId to 2 success events, fixed 1 error event
8. **turning.ts** - Added actionId to 1 success event, fixed 1 error event
9. **taking_off/taking-off.ts** - Added actionId to 1 success event, fixed 1 error event
10. **climbing.ts** - Fixed standalone functions to use `climbingAction.id` instead of `this.id`

### Pattern of Changes:
```typescript
// Before:
events.push(context.event('action.success', {
  messageId: 'taken',
  params: takenData
}));

// After:
events.push(context.event('action.success', {
  actionId: context.action.id,
  messageId: 'taken',
  params: takenData
}));
```

## Remaining Issues

1. **Not all files were fixed** - There are ~44 action files total, but only manually fixed about 10
2. **Build still failing** - The TypeScript compilation may still have issues
3. **Tests not re-run** - Haven't verified if the fixes actually resolve the test failures

## Scripts Created

Several fix scripts were created in the root directory:
- `fix-action-success.js` - Adds actionId to success events
- `fix-all-actionid.js` - Comprehensive fix for all action files
- `fix-this-id.js` - Changes `this.id` to `context.action.id`
- `comprehensive-final-fix.js` - Attempts to fix all issues

## Next Steps

1. **Run comprehensive fix**: 
   ```bash
   node comprehensive-final-fix.js
   ```

2. **Rebuild**:
   ```bash
   cd packages/stdlib
   pnpm build
   ```

3. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   pnpm test
   ```

4. **If still failing**, check:
   - Are there other action files that need the same fix?
   - Is the event structure what the tests actually expect?
   - Are there other missing fields besides `actionId`?

## Key Insight

The test utility (`packages/stdlib/tests/test-utils/index.ts`) expects `messageId`, `params`, and `reason` to be at the top level of the event payload/data, not nested. The `expectEvent` function specifically looks for these fields at `event.payload` or `event.data` level, not deeper.

## Alternative Approach

If the current fixes don't work, consider:
1. Checking if the `context.event()` method is creating the correct event structure
2. Verifying what structure the tests actually expect by looking at passing tests (if any)
3. Possibly modifying the `EnhancedActionContextImpl.event()` method to ensure proper event structure
