- **Reliability** - Fixing flaky tests
- **Performance** - Adding performance tests
- **Integration** - Adding integration tests

### Documentation
- **Updates** - Keeping docs current with code
- **Corrections** - Fixing errors and typos
- **Clarifications** - Improving unclear sections
- **Examples** - Adding or updating examples

### Dependencies
- **Updates** - Keeping dependencies current
- **Security** - Addressing security vulnerabilities
- **Removal** - Removing unnecessary dependencies
- **Replacement** - Replacing deprecated packages

## Migration Guides

### Version Migrations
- [0.0.x to 0.1.0](./migrations/0.0.x-to-0.1.0.md)
- [Dynamic to Static Loading](./migrations/dynamic-to-static.md)

### API Migrations
- [Parser API Changes](./migrations/parser-api.md)
- [Action System Updates](./migrations/action-system.md)
- [World Model Changes](./migrations/world-model.md)

## Bug Tracking

### Known Issues
Issues that are known but not yet fixed:
- Parser timeout issues in tests (partially resolved)
- Memory leaks in long-running games
- Edge cases in scope calculation

### Fixed Issues
Recently resolved issues:
- ✅ Factory functions removed in favor of constructor
- ✅ Dynamic imports causing test hangs
- ✅ Language provider missing methods

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics
- **Startup Time**: < 100ms target
- **Command Response**: < 50ms target
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB for typical game
- **Bundle Size**: < 200KB minified

### Optimization Opportunities
1. Parser caching
2. Lazy loading of actions
3. Entity pooling
4. Event batching

## Technical Debt

### Identified Debt
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Mixed async/sync APIs
- Duplicate validation logic
- Tight coupling in some modules

### Debt Reduction Plan
1. Standardize error handling with Result type
2. Make all APIs consistently async
3. Centralize validation
4. Improve module boundaries

## Maintenance Schedule

### Daily
- Monitor CI/CD pipeline
- Review error logs
- Check for security alerts

### Weekly
- Update dependencies
- Run full test suite
- Review open issues

### Monthly
- Performance profiling
- Code coverage analysis
- Documentation review
- Dependency audit

### Quarterly
- Major dependency updates
- Technical debt assessment
- Architecture review
- Security audit

## Tools and Scripts

### Maintenance Scripts
```bash
# Check for outdated dependencies
pnpm outdated

# Update dependencies
pnpm update

# Security audit
pnpm audit

# Fix linting issues
pnpm lint --fix

# Clean build artifacts
pnpm clean

# Rebuild all packages
pnpm rebuild
```

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Find TODO comments
grep -r "TODO" packages/

# Find deprecated code
grep -r "@deprecated" packages/

# Check bundle size
pnpm build && pnpm size

# Generate coverage report
pnpm test:coverage
```

## Contributing to Maintenance

### Reporting Issues
1. Check existing issues
2. Provide minimal reproduction
3. Include error messages
4. Specify version and environment

### Fixing Issues
1. Claim issue in GitHub
2. Write tests first
3. Fix the issue
4. Update documentation
5. Submit PR with tests

### Code Cleanup
1. Identify cleanup opportunity
2. Ensure tests pass
3. Make incremental changes
4. Maintain backwards compatibility
5. Document breaking changes

## Maintenance Best Practices

### Do's ✅
- Write tests before fixes
- Make small, focused changes
- Document your changes
- Run full test suite
- Update related documentation

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't mix features with fixes
- Don't ignore test failures
- Don't skip documentation
- Don't break backwards compatibility without notice
- Don't optimize prematurely
