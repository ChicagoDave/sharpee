/**
 * version.ts — the Chord LANGUAGE version (ADR-257).
 *
 * Chord the language carries its own semantic version, **independent of the
 * `@sharpee/*` lockstep** package version: the `@sharpee/chord` npm package
 * rides the platform release train (3.x), while this tracks *the language* and
 * moves only when the author-visible surface changes.
 *
 * Hand-maintained — **not** stamped by the release tooling (`tsf version` /
 * repokit `stampVersions`). Bumped on semver rules (ADR-257 D2): a new construct
 * or additive syntax → **minor**; a removed/renamed construct or a syntax an
 * existing story relied on that no longer parses → **major**; a spec/doc
 * correction with no grammar change → **patch**. Compiler bug fixes, IR-shape
 * refactors, and platform releases do NOT bump it.
 *
 * Distinct from `IR_FORMAT` (ir.ts) — the loader's wire-compat gate. The two move
 * on different triggers (ADR-257 D3): a purely additive language feature bumps
 * this version without touching the format. The `chord.ebnf` surface pin
 * (`tests/language-version.test.ts`, ADR-257 D5) fails the build if the grammar
 * changes without a bump here.
 *
 * **1.1.0 is a recorded one-time override of D2** (ADR-261 Consequences,
 * 2026-07-23). ADR-261 D4's `use scoring` gate stops previously-valid stories
 * from compiling, which D2 defines as a *major*; the owner ruled it ships as a
 * minor anyway rather than amending the rule or softening the gate. The next
 * construct that stops compiling is still a major unless someone rules
 * otherwise again — the exception is cross-noted at ADR-257 D2 so it is
 * discoverable from the rule.
