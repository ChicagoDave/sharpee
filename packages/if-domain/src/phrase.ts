/**
 * @file Phrase algebra — language-neutral phrase contracts (ADR-192).
 *
 * Purpose: declare the closed `Phrase` discriminated union, its producer and
 * render-context contracts, and the per-locale `Assembler` interface. These are
 * the language-neutral surface of the phrase algebra that replaces the
 * `messageId → formatter-chain → string` pipeline with
 * `messageId → phrase tree → Assembler → ITextBlock[]`.
 *
 * Public interface: the `Phrase` union (16 members), `PhraseProducer`,
 * `RenderContext` (with the `reference` / `textState` / `contribute` write +
 * `slotContributions` read seams), `Assembler`, and the `isX` kind type guards.
 *
 * Owner context: `@sharpee/if-domain` — language-neutral domain contracts,
 * beside `language-provider.ts` and `contracts.ts`. INVARIANT (ADR-192 AC-10):
 * this file contains NO locale logic and NO article surface strings
 * (a / an / the / some). Article realization belongs to the English Assembler in
 * `@sharpee/lang-en-us`; `articleType` here is a language-neutral selector only.
 *
 * Extensibility (ADR-192 §1): `Phrase` is a CLOSED discriminated union keyed by
 * `kind`. The five foundational kinds are implemented by the Assembler in
 * ADR-192; `Verb` (199), `Verbatim` (200), `Numeral` (198), `Pronoun` (197), and
 * `Contents` (194) are realized follow-on atoms; the remaining three stub kinds are
 * reserved discriminants whose fields and realization land additively in their
 * follow-on ADRs (193 adjectives, 195 Slot, 196 Optional/Choice). Extension is
 * additive only — a new member plus a new Assembler case, never a rewrite.
