# Engine Package Implementation Summary

## What We Built

### 1. Event Sequencing System
- **SequencedEvent type**: Extends events with turn.order.subOrder
- **EventSequencer**: Manages sequence numbers within turns
- **Turn phases**: PRE, MAIN, POST, CLEANUP for event organization
- **Utilities**: Sort events, group by turn/phase, format sequences

### 2. Command Executor
- **Orchestrates the full flow**: Input → Parse → Resolve → Execute → Process
- **Creates contexts**: ResolverContext and ActionContext from GameContext
- **Handles errors**: With proper error commands and messages
- **Tracks recent entities**: For pronoun resolution and preferences

### 3. Game Engine
- **Main runtime**: Manages game state, turns, and subsystems
- **Turn management**: Executes turns, maintains history, emits events
- **Vocabulary updates**: Keeps entity vocabulary in sync with scope
- **Save/Load**: Basic state serialization (can be enhanced)
- **Event emitter**: For game events (turn:start, turn:complete, etc.)

## Architecture Integration

```
GameEngine
    ├── CommandExecutor
    │   ├── Parser (from stdlib)
    │   ├── Resolver (from stdlib)
    │   ├── Actions (from actions package)
    │   └── EventProcessor (from event-processor)
    ├── EventSequencer
    ├── World Model
    └── Game Context
```

## Key Features

### Event Sequencing
- Events numbered as turn.order (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 2.1)
- Sub-events supported (e.g., 1.2.1, 1.2.2)
- Automatic phase detection
- Proper sorting and grouping utilities

### Turn Execution Flow
1. Parse user input
2. Resolve entities
3. Execute action → get events
4. Sequence events with turn numbers
5. Process events → world changes
6. Update context and history
7. Emit turn complete

### Game State Management
- Turn counter
- Command history (with configurable limit)
- Player reference
- Game metadata
- Custom state support

## Design Principles Maintained

✅ **Event-driven**: All changes through sequenced events
✅ **No direct mutation**: Actions return events, processor applies them
✅ **Extensible**: Config options, event listeners, custom error handlers
✅ **Clean separation**: Engine doesn't know about text generation
✅ **TypeScript throughout**: Full type safety

## What's Working

The demo shows:
- Complete command execution flow
- Event sequencing (1.1, 1.2, etc.)
- Error handling
- State management
- Vocabulary synchronization

## Next Steps

1. **Text Generation** - Read sequenced events and generate output
2. **Story Integration** - Load TypeScript story files
3. **Enhanced Save/Load** - Better world serialization
4. **Game-specific engines** - Extend base engine for specific games
5. **Testing** - Comprehensive test suite

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Create and start engine
const engine = createStandardEngine();
engine.start();

// Execute turns
const result = await engine.executeTurn('take sword');

// Events are sequenced: 1.1, 1.2, etc.
result.events.forEach(event => {
  const seq = EventSequenceUtils.getSequenceString(event);
  console.log(`${seq}: ${event.type}`);
});
```

The engine is now ready to run Sharpee games! We just need text generation to see the output.
