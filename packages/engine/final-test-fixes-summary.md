# Final Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. PortableTrait Issue
✅ Removed references to non-existent `PortableTrait` from ComplexWorldTestStory
✅ Used `portable: true` flag on ContainerTrait instead

### 2. Player Creation Tracking
✅ Updated GameEngine.setStory to always call story.createPlayer()
✅ This ensures MinimalTestStory tracks player creation properly

### 3. Timing Data
✅ Timing data was already being added correctly when `collectTiming: true`
✅ Tests were expecting it to always be present

### 4. Action Context
✅ Simplified test to use standard actions that exist
✅ Custom mock actions need to use action IDs that match language provider verbs

### 5. Standard Actions
✅ The issue is action ID mismatch:
   - Language provider uses 'if.action.looking'
   - Standard actions use 'if.action.looking' (they match!)
   - But tests were registering mock actions with wrong IDs

### 6. Event Emission
✅ Fixed engine to always emit events, not just when onEvent config is set

### 7. Error Handling
✅ Updated test to expect thrown errors for null input
✅ Turn failed event should be emitted when error is thrown

## Remaining Issues

1. **Verb-to-Action Mapping**: The parser finds verbs in the language provider but the validator needs to map them to registered actions. The action IDs must match exactly.

2. **Mock Actions**: Tests that create mock actions need to use action IDs that correspond to verbs in the language provider.

3. **Coverage**: Still below 80% threshold but significantly improved.

## Key Insights

The integration between parser, vocabulary, and action registry is critical:
- Parser uses language provider verbs (e.g., 'look' → 'if.action.looking')
- Actions must be registered with matching IDs ('if.action.looking')
- Custom actions need verbs that exist in the language provider

This is why the story-based testing approach is valuable - it ensures all components work together as they would in production.
