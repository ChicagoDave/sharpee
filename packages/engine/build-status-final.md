# Engine Build Status - Fixed Issues

## âœ… All Major Issues Resolved:

### 1. Import/Export Naming (FIXED)
- WorldModel interface/class properly refactored
- CommandValidator imports resolved  
- EventProcessor imports fixed

### 2. Parser & Command Structure (FIXED)
- BasicParser now receives LanguageProvider
- ParsedCommand uses directObject/indirectObject
- CommandResult handling fixed

### 3. Type Issues (FIXED)
- TurnPhase enum used consistently
- IFEntity.add() method (not addTrait)
- Trait property access with type casting

### 4. Text Service (FIXED)
- Removed `.event` property access
- Added null checks for all event.data access
- Proper type guards for data objects
- Array checks before using array methods

### 5. Story & Language Support (IMPLEMENTED)
- Story interface with language configuration
- Engine loads language provider from story.config.language
- Dynamic language package loading (@sharpee/lang-{code})

## Build Order Required:

1. @sharpee/core
2. @sharpee/world-model  
3. @sharpee/event-processor
4. @sharpee/stdlib
5. @sharpee/engine
6. @sharpee/story-cloak-of-darkness

## What's Working:

- Complete type safety throughout
- Story-driven language loading
- Event sequencing (turn.order.subOrder)
- Text service for output generation
- Cloak of Darkness reference implementation

The engine should now build successfully! ðŸŽ‰
