- How do mirrors "know" each other for connections? Line of sight? Previous physical contact? Mental image?

This is mechanical. The actor 'connects' two mirrors. The two mirrors are entities with MirrorTrait and that has meta data for connections

  - Should there be a way to detect invisible Moon carriers? (dusty floors, water puddles, etc.)

This is just narrative stuff. We don't need anything systemic.

  - Can Silver carriers sense when someone else travels through "their" mirrors?

100% - if an actor has a connection setup to a mirror, any travel through that mirror will cause ripple in their senses - but we might want to limit this to line of sight mirrors (unsure)

  - Does the story need a way to block/ward mirrors from connection?

  If a mirror is face down on a floor or backwards against a wall, connections can be made, but travel is blocked

  A ceiling-mounted mirror would cause an entrance to be like falling

  A mirror face up on a floor could be entered by "walk on mirror" or "step on mirror"

  A small mirror on the back of your cellphone could be entered instantly (and the phone holder would have mastered the ability to carry objects with - so even though it seems odd, the held mirror can still act as a full travel connection)

  A mirror covered by a tarp or cloth could be exited, but not entered

  physical touch is always required to act on a mirror
