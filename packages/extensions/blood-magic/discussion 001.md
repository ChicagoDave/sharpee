  Key Design Questions

  Mirror Mechanics

  1. Connection persistence - Should mirror connections be:
    - Permanent until broken or removed/erased

we might want to have a super command like **erase all connections** but only if we find a need in the story

  2. LOOK/LISTEN THROUGH MIRROR - These are excellent for reconnaissance.
  Should they:
    - Work only on connected mirrors? YES
    - Be detectable by people at the other location? NO
    - Have range limitations? mirrors can be chained, but we could set limits if more than three mirrors are chained
  3. Mirror signatures - When someone uses a mirror, their signature remains.
  Should:
    - Signatures fade over time? YES - but I might have time be a story progression mechanism so we might use hours as the measurement - TBD

  Moon Blood Mechanics

  1. TOUCH MOON / FORGET MOON - Interesting poetic phrasing. Should:
    - Only work when moon is visible/present? NO
    - Work metaphorically (touching something that represents the moon)? YES, so the daughter may have a moon-shaped necklace she touches as a visibility toggle
    - Have a physical gesture component? NO
  2. Invisibility scope effects - When invisible:
    - Can the person still interact with objects? YES
    - Do they leave traces (footprints, disturbed dust)? YES
    - Can they pass through mirrors while invisible? YES

  Story Integration

  1. The Old Woman with Blood of Stars - This is a powerful narrative device.
  She could:
    - Provide cryptic hints if approached correctly (TBD)
    - React to major story events in real-time (as asides, like an italicized paragraph after critical moments in the story progression - Janny Wurts does this in her Wars of Light and Shadow series)
    - Be the source of the "multiple endings" - NO - she only sees the here and now

  2. Character knowledge - Important to track:
    - The Thief doesn't know about his daughter
    - The Girl doesn't know her parentage initially
    - The Old Man doesn't know about his granddaughter
    - Who knows about which blood powers?

this is all narratively controlled, so likely a NO, but also TBD

  Technical Considerations

  1. Trait composition - Should blood powers be:
    - A single trait with multiple powers? NO
    - Separate traits that can be combined? YES
    - Inherited through a bloodline system? Narrative only
  2. Action availability - Should blood actions:
    - Always be available to attempt (fail if no power)? always there
    - Only appear in parser when character has the power? - it's jut there like breathing
