/**
 * @sharpee/channel-service/wire — client-side decoder
 *
 * Owner context: wire-protocol module. A small state machine the
 * consumer feeds incoming packets through. Enforces the ordering
 * invariants from ADR-163 §11 / AC-11:
 *
 *   1. The first server-bound packet a consumer accepts is `cmgt`.
 *   2. `turn` packets are accepted only after `cmgt`.
 *   3. `hello` and `command` are not server-bound — receiving one is a
 *      protocol error.
 *
 * The decoder does NOT render — it only validates ordering and exposes
 * the negotiated manifest. Renderer dispatch is the consumer's
 * concern (per ADR-165).
 *
 * @see ADR-163 §11 — bootstrap order invariants
