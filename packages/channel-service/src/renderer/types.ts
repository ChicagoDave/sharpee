/**
 * @sharpee/channel-service/renderer — consumer-side type contracts.

 * Owner context: consumer side of channel-I/O. Defines the
 * `ChannelRenderer` plug-in shape, the `Renderer` host that drives
 * packets into renderers, and the small `SlotHandle` abstraction the
 * default layouts use to address output regions.
 *
 * Public interface (per ADR-165 §1, §2, §5, §7):
 *  - `ChannelRenderer` — per-channel rendering contract; only
 *    `onValue` is required.
 *  - `Renderer` — top-level host the consumer drives.
 *  - `ChannelStateStore` — in-memory state per channel id (replace
 *    keeps latest, append accumulates, event has no entry).
 *  - `SlotHandle` — opaque handle the default layouts use; concrete
 *    consumers narrow to `HTMLElement` (DOM), terminal region (CLI),
 *    or whatever their output medium uses.
 *
 * No implementation lives here. Pure types so renderer-host packages
 * (browser, CLI, multi-user) and channel-renderer authors share a
 * single contract.
 *
 * @see ADR-165 — Renderer Architecture
