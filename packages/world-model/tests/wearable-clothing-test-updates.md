# Wearable and Clothing Test Suite Updates

## Overview
The test suite has been updated to match the new trait architecture for wearables and clothing. The refactoring maintains the separation between simple wearables (jewelry, accessories) and clothing (items that can contain pockets).

## Key Changes

### 1. Test Helper Functions
Added new helper functions in `test-entities.ts`:
- `createTestClothing()` - Creates clothing items with ClothingTrait and ContainerTrait
- `createTestPocket()` - Creates pocket containers with SceneryTrait
- `createTestWearable()` - Creates simple wearable items (jewelry, etc.)

### 2. New Test Files
- **`clothing.test.ts`** - Unit tests for ClothingTrait
  - Tests inheritance from WearableTrait
  - Tests clothing-specific properties (material, style, condition)
  - Tests clothing with pockets functionality
  
- **`wearable-clothing.test.ts`** - Integration tests for the complete system
  - Tests basic wearable behavior
  - Tests clothing with functional pockets
  - Tests layered clothing systems
  - Tests complex pocket hierarchies
  - Performance tests

### 3. Updated Existing Tests
- Fixed property references from `worn` to `isWorn` in WearableTrait
- Updated trait-combinations.test.ts to use new helper functions
- Ensured all tests properly handle the new trait structure

## Architecture Validation

### Clothing with Pockets Pattern
```typescript
// Create clothing that can hold pockets
const coat = createTestClothing(world, 'Winter Coat', {
  slot: 'torso',
  material: 'wool'
});

// Create pockets as separate scenery containers
const pocket = createTestPocket(world, 'inner pocket', 5);

// Attach pocket to clothing
world.moveEntity(pocket.id, coat.id);
```

### Key Design Decisions Validated
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clothing items are containers that hold pocket entities
2. **Pocket Immobility**: Pockets have SceneryTrait to prevent taking them separately
3. **Visibility**: Items in pockets remain visible when clothing is worn
4. **Hierarchy Support**: Nested containers in pockets work correctly
5. **Performance**: Efficient filtering of worn vs carried items

## Test Coverage
- ✅ Basic wearable functionality
- ✅ Clothing-specific properties
- ✅ Pocket creation and attachment
- ✅ Item visibility in worn clothing
- ✅ Layered clothing systems
- ✅ Mixed wearables and clothing
- ✅ Complex hierarchies (containers in pockets)
- ✅ Special properties (blocksSlots, canRemove)
- ✅ Performance with many items

## Next Steps
1. Run the test suite to ensure all tests pass
2. Consider adding tests for:
   - Slot conflict resolution
   - Clothing damage during gameplay
   - Save/load with worn items
   - Events for wearing/removing items
