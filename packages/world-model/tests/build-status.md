# Build Status Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed ClothingTrait Type Issue
- Changed ClothingTrait from extending WearableTrait to implementing Trait directly
- ClothingTrait now has its own type (TraitType.CLOTHING) without conflicting with parent
- Includes all WearableData properties to maintain compatibility

### 2. Updated implementations.ts
- Added ClothingTrait import
- Added ClothingTrait to TRAIT_IMPLEMENTATIONS map
- Added ClothingTrait to exports

### 3. Updated Tests
- Modified clothing.test.ts to not expect inheritance from WearableTrait
- Tests now verify that ClothingTrait has all wearable properties

### 4. Updated WorldModel
- Enhanced getContents() to check both WEARABLE and CLOTHING traits when filtering worn items

## Build Command
```bash
pnpm --filter @sharpee/world-model build
```

## Expected Result
The build should now succeed with:
- No type conflicts between ClothingTrait and WearableTrait
- ClothingTrait properly registered in the trait system
- All tests properly updated to match the new architecture
