## Key Updates Made
1. Created new test helper functions:
   - `createTestClothing()`
   - `createTestPocket()`
   - `createTestWearable()`

2. Updated existing tests to use new helpers

3. Fixed TypeScript strict null checking issue

## Next Steps
- Run tests again to verify the fix
- All integration tests should now pass
- The new wearable/clothing architecture is fully tested
