# Phase 1 Status: ADR-041 Implementation

## Completed Tasks

### 1.1 Update Core Interfaces ✅
- [x] Updated `enhanced-types.ts` to simplify `EnhancedActionContext` interface
  - [x] Kept only `event(type: string, data: any): SemanticEvent` method
  - [x] Removed `emitSuccess()`, `emitError()`, `emit()`, `emitMany()`, `createEvent()`
  - [x] Added comprehensive JSDoc with examples
  
### 1.2 Update Implementation ✅
- [x] Updated `enhanced-context.ts` implementation
  - [x] Implemented single `event()` method that delegates to internal `createEventInternal()`
  - [x] Kept internal implementation intact for backward compatibility
  - [x] Automatic entity injection still works
  - [x] Metadata enrichment still works
  - [x] Removed deprecated methods from public interface

### 1.3 Documentation ✅
- [x] Created migration guide at `src/actions/migration-guide-adr-041.md`
- [x] Documented the new `event()` method usage with examples
- [x] Provided migration patterns for common scenarios

### 1.4 Reference Implementation ✅
- [x] Updated `closing` action to use new pattern
- [x] Added comment indicating it follows ADR-041
- [x] Demonstrates all migration patterns:
  - Simple errors
  - Errors with parameters
  - Complex errors with additional data
  - Success events with typed data
  - Multiple events

## Design Decision

I kept the internal implementation methods (`emitSuccess`, `emitError`, etc.) as private methods because:
1. It minimizes breaking changes - the internal logic remains the same
2. The `event()` method delegates to `createEventInternal()` which has all the existing logic
3. This ensures backward compatibility at the implementation level

## Testing Impact

The tests should continue to work because:
1. The `EnhancedActionContextImpl` class still exists
2. The `event()` method provides the same functionality
3. Test utilities create contexts the same way

## Next Steps

For Phase 2 (ADR-042), we need to:
1. Run tests to ensure nothing is broken
2. Start migrating stdlib actions to use the new `event()` method
3. Create typed event interfaces for each action
4. Reorganize actions into folder structure

## Breaking Changes

This is technically a breaking change for:
- Extensions that use the old context methods
- Stories that create custom actions using old methods

However, the migration is straightforward following the patterns in the migration guide.
