# StdLib Service Layer Implementation Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Created Core Services
We've implemented the four core services as described in the design document:

- **InventoryService**: Handles complex container operations, transfers, weight/volume calculations
- **VisibilityService**: Manages scope, visibility checks, reachability, and lighting
- **MovementService**: Handles entity movement, navigation validation, and pathfinding
- **RoomService**: Manages room connections, lighting, descriptions, and spatial relationships
- **ParserService**: Provides world-aware parsing with entity disambiguation

### 2. Enhanced Action Context
Created a new ActionContext that includes all services:
```typescript
export interface ActionContext {
  world: IFWorld;
  player: IFEntity;
  services: {
    room: RoomService;
    inventory: InventoryService;
    visibility: VisibilityService;
    movement: MovementService;
    parser: ParserService;
    text: TextService;
  };
  language: IFLanguageProvider;
  emit(event: SemanticEvent): void;
  fail(reason: ActionFailureReason, data?: any): SemanticEvent;
}
```

### 3. Base Action Executor Pattern
Created `BaseActionExecutor` that provides a standard execution flow:
1. Validation phase
2. Execution phase
3. Post-processing phase

### 4. Service-Based Action Example
Created a refactored `TakingActionExecutor` that uses services instead of direct behavior calls.

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Actions focus on flow, services handle complexity
2. **Reusability**: Services can be used by multiple actions
3. **Testability**: Each service can be tested independently
4. **Consistency**: Business logic centralized in services
5. **Extensibility**: New features added to services benefit all consumers

## Next Steps

1. **Refactor Remaining Actions**: Update all actions to use the service-based approach
2. **Add Tests**: Create comprehensive tests for each service
3. **Implement TextService**: Complete the text generation service
4. **Update Forge**: Modify Forge to use the service layer
5. **Documentation**: Add detailed API documentation for each service

## Migration Guide

To migrate from direct behavior usage to service-based:

### Old Pattern:
```typescript
if (ContainerBehavior.canAccept(container, item)) {
  world.moveEntity(item.id, container.id);
}
```

### New Pattern:
```typescript
const transferred = context.services.inventory.transfer(item, from, to);
```

The service layer handles validation, side effects, and event generation automatically.
