# Parser-World Integration Complete

## Summary

The parser-world integration has been successfully completed, connecting the enhanced grammar-based parser with the IFWorld model to provide context-aware command parsing.

## Key Components Added

### 1. World-Aware Parser (`world-aware-parser.ts`)
- Bridges the enhanced parser with IFWorld
- Automatically calculates scope from world state
- Tracks recently mentioned entities for pronoun resolution
- Provides simplified parse() method that doesn't require manual scope

### 2. Scope Hint Resolver (`scope-hint-resolver.ts`)
- Resolves scope hints (held, container, reachable, etc.) using world state
- `WorldScopeHintResolver`: Uses IFWorld to check entity properties
- `StaticScopeHintResolver`: For testing without world state
- Provides human-readable descriptions of hints for error messages

### 3. Integration Module Structure
```
parser/
  integration/
    world-aware-parser.ts      # Main integration point
    scope-hint-resolver.ts     # Scope hint resolution logic
    index.ts                   # Module exports
    __tests__/
      integration.test.ts      # Comprehensive integration tests
```

## Enhanced Story Class

The Story class now uses the world-aware parser by default:

```typescript
const story = createStory({ language: US_EN });
const world = story.getWorld();

// Add entities to world...

// Parse commands with automatic scope calculation
const result = story.parse('take brass key');
```

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Scope Calculation
- Parser automatically gets current scope from world
- No need to manually calculate visible/reachable entities
- Respects darkness, containers, and visibility rules

### 2. Scope Hint Integration
- **held**: Checks if entity is in player inventory
- **container**: Verifies entity has container attribute
- **reachable**: Uses world's reachability calculation
- **visible**: Uses world's visibility calculation
- **worn**: Checks if worn by player
- And 11 more hint types

### 3. Recently Mentioned Tracking
- Automatically tracks entities mentioned in commands
- Enables pronoun resolution ("it", "them")
- Configurable history limit (default: 10)
- Updates on both successful commands and disambiguation

### 4. Real-World State Awareness
- Parser understands current world state
- Respects containment hierarchy
- Handles darkness and light sources
- Considers open/closed containers

## Example Usage

```typescript
// Create world and add objects
const world = story.getWorld();
const box = EntityFactory.createContainer({
  id: 'box',
  name: 'box',
  open: true
});
world.addEntity(box);

// Parser understands world state
const result = story.parse('put coin in box');
// Parser knows box is a container and is open
```

## Integration Tests

Comprehensive test suite covers:
- Basic parsing with world scope
- Objects not in scope
- Scope hint validation
- Recently mentioned tracking
- Nested containers
- Darkness and light sources
- Disambiguation with world context

## Benefits

1. **Simplified API**: Authors just call `story.parse(input)` 
2. **Context Awareness**: Parser understands world state
3. **Better Disambiguation**: Scope hints reduce ambiguity
4. **Pronoun Support**: Automatic tracking of recent mentions
5. **Error Messages**: Context-aware error messages

## Next Steps

With parser-world integration complete, the next major task is:

### Design and implement the action system
- Define action phases (before, check, carry out, after, report)
- Create command execution pipeline
- Integrate with event system
- Implement standard IF actions

The integrated parser now provides rich command objects that are ready to be executed by the action system.
