# Work Summary - Looking Action Implementation
Date: January 3, 2025

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the "Unknown action: if.action.looking" error in the Cloak of Darkness test by implementing the missing "look" action in the standard library.

## Changes Made

### 1. Implemented Looking Action
**File**: `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/looking/looking.ts`
- Created new action executor for "look" command
- ID: `if.action.looking`
- Aliases: `['look', 'l']`
- Generates three events:
  - `player.looked` - Records the action
  - `text.room_description` - Triggers room description output
  - `text.list_contents` - Lists visible items

### 2. Updated Standard Actions Registry
**File**: `/packages/stdlib/src/actions/standard/index.ts`
- Added export for looking module
- Added `lookingAction` to `standardActions` array

### 3. Fixed ActionExecutor Interface Compliance
- Removed invalid `name` property from looking action
- ActionExecutor only requires: `id`, `execute()`, and optionally `aliases` and `canExecute()`

### 4. Updated Text Service
**File**: `/packages/engine/src/text-service/text-service.ts`
- Added handlers for new event types:
  - `player.looked` - Empty output (marker event)
  - `text.room_description` - Placeholder: "[Need to describe room: roomId]"
  - `text.list_contents` - Formats visible items list

### 5. Improved Error Handling
**File**: `/stories/cloak-of-darkness/src/test-runner.ts`
- Added try-catch around command execution
- Logs errors but continues with remaining commands
- Prevents test runner crash on single command failure

### 6. Fixed Build Configuration
**File**: `/stories/cloak-of-darkness/tsconfig.json`
- Changed module from "ES2022" to "commonjs" to match rest of system
- Build script already creates correct temporary config

## Build and Run Instructions

```bash
# Full rebuild and test
./rebuild-and-test.sh

# Or manually:
./quick-build-v2.sh  # Builds all packages in order
./run-cloak-simple.sh  # Runs the test
```

## Current Output
The "look" command is now recognized and produces output like:
```
> look
[player.looked]
[Need to describe room: foyer]
You can see: cloak
```

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Room Description Retrieval**
   - Text service needs to fetch actual descriptions from world model
   - Use entity's IDENTITY trait description field

2. **Implement Entity Name Resolution**
   - Replace entity IDs with proper names in output
   - Use language provider's getEntityName() method

3. **Complete Text Service Implementation**
   - Move from "all events" template to proper text generation
   - Implement templates for common game messages

4. **Add More Standard Actions**
   - Inventory action
   - Help/about actions
   - Save/restore actions

## Design Principles Maintained
- ✅ Event-driven architecture - actions generate events
- ✅ No direct state mutation in actions
- ✅ Separation of game logic from text output
- ✅ Standard library pattern for common functionality
- ✅ Language-agnostic core with pluggable text generation
