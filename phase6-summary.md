# Phase 6 Complete - Fixed Circular Dependencies

## What We Did

We successfully moved actions from a separate package into stdlib, eliminating the circular dependency issue.

### Key Changes

1. **Moved Actions to Stdlib**
   - Created `packages/stdlib/src/actions/` directory
   - Moved all action implementations from `@sharpee/actions` to `@sharpee/stdlib/actions`
   - Moved IFActions constants to stdlib
   - Moved action types, registry, and context to stdlib

2. **Updated Imports**
   - Fixed command-patterns.ts to use local IFActions
   - Fixed command-syntax.ts to use local IFActions  
   - Fixed command-validator.ts to use local ActionRegistry
   - Removed stdlib dependency from actions package.json

3. **Removed Circular Dependency**
   - Actions are now part of stdlib
   - Stdlib depends on world-model (for IFEntity, WorldModel)
   - No circular dependencies!

## Architecture Now

```
@sharpee/core
├── Basic types (Entity, SemanticEvent, ParsedCommand, ValidatedCommand)
└── No IF-specific content

@sharpee/world-model  
├── IFEntity
├── IFEvents constants
├── Traits
└── WorldModel implementation

@sharpee/stdlib
├── actions/
│   ├── standard/ (taking, dropping, examining, etc.)
│   ├── types.ts (ActionExecutor, ActionContext)
│   ├── registry.ts
│   └── constants.ts (IFActions)
├── parser/
├── validation/
├── commands/
└── language/

Dependencies:
- stdlib → world-model, core
- world-model → core
- No circular dependencies!
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Architecture**: Actions live with the rest of the standard library
2. **No Circular Dependencies**: Clean dependency graph
3. **Easier to Understand**: Everything IF-specific is in stdlib and world-model
4. **Better Cohesion**: Parser, validator, and actions all in one package

## Next Steps

With Phase 6 complete, we can now:

1. **Clean up**: Remove the now-unused @sharpee/actions package
2. **Continue to Phase 5**: Update the engine to use the new command flow
3. **Fix remaining build errors**: Update any remaining references
4. **Test**: Verify everything works with the new structure

The refactor is coming together nicely! The three-phase architecture (parse → validate → execute) is now properly implemented without circular dependencies.
